# Build on Composable: Ecosystem Development

*To help usher in the interoperable future of DeFi, Composable Finance is launching a program to support developers building projects with our technology. This includes projects using our Picasso palle*

---

## Ecosystem-as-a-Service Model

Composable offers an Ecosystem-as-a-Service model, supporting the development of a number of other projects - both internal and external - that leverage Composable’s technology and ecosystem. Some projects supported so far include: 

### Whirlpool Cash:

An enhanced privacy protocol with rewards from asset tumbling and yield farming on Picasso.

### Angular Finance:

An isolated lending pair protocol on Kusama to allow risk-isolated loans. 

### Bribe: 

Innovative governance tooling for the cross-layer, Polkadot, and Web 3.0 future.

### Cyclical Finance:

Decentralizing the network validation for Ethereum 2.0 and beyond. 

### Instrumental Finance:

A cross-layer, cross-chain LP position movement and arbitrage protocol.

[Composable Labs](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/introducing-composable-labs-an-incubator-and-testing-ground-for-projects-using-composables-tech-b467d438142c), the incubation and testing ground of Composable Finance, is excited to announce the **Composable Grant Program**. This program invites developers to submit proposals to either build projects or pallets for our parachain Picasso, or create applications that will be forerunners in our seamlessly interoperable cross-layer ecosystem. As part of our initiative, we will be offering grants and developmental assistance to the projects using our technology in one of these two manners, with particular emphasis on supporting those that provide crucial functionalities or are especially innovative.

The program allows us to support and award the most promising projects using our infrastructure by providing them with funding in addition to developmental assistance from our own team. Our grants program has two divisions

- **The Pallets Program**: invites developers to build Substrate pallets onto our Picasso parachain, helping to build out a complete offering of all DeFi functionalities (from basic to advanced) as building blocks for future developers to easily architect powerful dApps on Picasso
- **The Cross-Layer Applications Program**: invites developers to leverage our software development kit (SDK) to use our technology to build interoperable applications that are native to the Composable ecosystem

---

## The Applicants We Are Seeking:

The Composable Grants Program has two categories: pallet and project development for our Picasso parachain, and cross-layer dApps. Those interested in building pallets on Picasso are playing an important role in developing the building blocks for an interoperable DeFi ecosystem on Polkadot and Kusama. Users developing cross-layer dApps will be leveraging the software development kit (SDK) of Mosaic, our layer 2-layer 2 digital asset transferal system, to provide end-users with cutting edge applications that embrace the cross-layer future of DeFi.

## The Resources Provided To Developers:

The ingenuity of developers is at the core of DeFi’s growth towards a more end-user-friendly and optimized industry. As stated in the [announcement](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/picasso-f17705da670e) of Picasso, we see the potential for dApps built in our ecosystem to only be limited by a developer’s imagination. In order to untether this potential, it is essential to provide resources to smooth the creative and developmental process.

For both grant categories, we will award funding to projects built that show promise in generating solutions to some of DeFi’s most pressing issues, as well as those that take beloved DeFi services to the next level of utility.

Beyond funding, developers working on Polkadot and Kusama will be given access to our oracle and vault pallets, [Apollo](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/introducing-apollo-an-mev-resistant-oracle-884efae18848) and [Cubic](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/introducing-cubic-setting-the-standard-for-vault-infrastructure-in-polkadot-and-kusama-8c1ab9390c5f). Developers working on Ethereum will get access to [Mosaic](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/introducing-mosaic-tackling-cross-layer-2-liquidity-provisioning-through-delivering-a-new-means-of-1c1edb8691df), which will facilitate the development of cross-layer dApp projects. Once an Ethereum project reaches a certain stage of development, Composable’s team can also help port it to [Rust pallets](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/pallets) and deploy them on our parachain.

Along with a grant, a key piece of Composable’s added value is the team we have to support you. Grant participants will be able to leverage the Composable team in order to assist with furthering their product development roadmap. Additionally, in some cases, we might jump in and build alongside some of the teams we select for our grants program. We are currently doing this with Composable Labs, and would certainly expand it to the grants program on a case by case basis.

## Building Pallets for Composable

Composable’s Substrate pallets provide the LEGO-like building blocks for developers to build interoperable applications on Picasso. As noted, our team is currently working on a number of pallets. In order to reach our goal of providing a complete list of offerings to make building on our ecosystem as simple as possible, we are providing grants for pallet developers, as well as those leveraging our pallets to create applications.

We are focused on three separate pallet tracks for our grants: primitive, core and application. Primitive track grant recipients will provide pallets for essential tools such as smart contracts, tokens and governance. Core track teams will leverage the primitive pallets to create building blocks which allow for user interaction and value generation. The application track will be for people who leverage both primitive pallets and core functionalities.

## Building Cross-Layer dApps on Mosaic

Composable Finance has built an [SDK](../developer-guides/composable-sdk.html) with Mosaic in order to facilitate development on layer 2 (L2). Presently, Mosaic is conducting its [proof of concept](https://composablefi.medium.com/testing-mosaic-through-our-arbitrum-polygon-transferal-system-proof-of-concept-4e459e24e427) (PoC) and on its way to full operability.

With Mosaic, we are enabling assets and information to move seamlessly across L2 solutions. As a result, movement between all of the many decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, and other DeFi protocols is possibl.

This dispatch system will also eventually enable cross-layer function calls. This is crucial infrastructure which allows for individual smart contracts from disparate layer 2 solutions to directly communicate. Smart contracts on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), for example, will be able to talk to smart contracts on [Arbitrum](https://offchainlabs.com/).

Given this wide scope of possibilities, our cross-layer grant recipients can have a diverse set of interests:

*Yield farming enthusiast*? Use Composable’s SDK to build a cross-layer yield aggregator, allowing for maximal yield generation.

*Crypto-lending connoisseur*? Use cross-layer function calls to build a flash loan protocol which can leap across L2s within a single block time.

This is just the beginning. Even here at Composable, we are still discovering the full extent to which this technology can be applied. Even if you are not seeking a grant, we still invite you to work with our SDK to see what you can build!
