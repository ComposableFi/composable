Our near term goals are to complete development and drive usage of each layer of the Composable stack. 
Currently, we have Mosaic live, and with the Composable software development kit (SDK), we will be able to begin 
educating users about this cross-layer/cross-chain arbitrage opportunity, which can then lend itself to the 
understanding of our broader vision. Furthermore, we are continuously building more pallets to strengthen the 
foundational layer of our tech stack, that is our parachain.

The next phase for Composable is to integrate Picasso with the 
[inter-blockchain communication protocol](https://ibcprotocol.org/) (IBC). Through this step, we will enable cross-chain
communication with every blockchain that uses IBC.

To do this, we will be utilizing Substrate to create the bridge infrastructure to connect our parachain to IBC. 
Beyond this, we will work to improve Mosaic’s cross-layer communication so that our transferal system can connect with 
our IBC-Picasso bridge. With this integration, we will look to generalize Mosaic to be a liquidity model that will 
extend across ecosystems.

From there, we will begin drawing on the *ink!* VM model to develop the Composable Cross-Chain VM, which will spring 
forth the ability f
