## Set Relayer 

`set_relayer`

Sets the current Relayer configuration.

This is enacted immediately and invalidates inflight, incoming transactions from
the previous Relayer. However, existing budgets relain in place.

This can only be called by the[`ControlOrigin`](#controlorigin). 
### Rotate Relayer

`rotate_relayer`

Rotates the relay account.

#### Restrictions

This is only callable by the current Relayer.

The Time To Live (TTL) must be greater than the [`MinimumTTL`](#minimumttl).

### Set Network

`set_network`

Sets the supported networks and maximum transaction sizes accepted by the 
Relayer.

This can only be called by the current Relayer.

### Set Budget

`set_budget`

Sets the Relayer budget for incoming transactions for specific assets.

This does not reset the current `penalty`.

This can only be called by the [`ControlOrigin`](#controlorigin).

### Transfer To 

`transfer_to`

Creates an outgoing transaction request.

Locks the funds locally until picked up by the Relayer.

#### Restrictions

* The network must be supported

* The asset ID must be supported

* The amount must have sufficient funds

* The origin must have sufficient funds

* Transactions that cause overflows (due to being too close to exceeding the max 
  balance) will be caught and returned as errors
