# Audit Results, Recommendations, and Remediations

---

The Composable Finance coding has been audited by renowned security auditing firm [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/). This near decade-old cybersecurity auditing firm has worked to secure some of the most prominent and highly targeted software products and technology organizations.

Once Trail of Bits had reviewed the code, the firm made suggestions on addressing any points of weakness, which were implemented.

Suggestions and subsequent fixes resulting from the audit are available [here](https://github.com/ComposableFi/parachain-strategies/tree/main/audits) on our Github.
