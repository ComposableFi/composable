### Referral Bonus

We implemented a referral program where users were able to generate referral codes and obtain a 20% bonus on their PICA tokens if they brought in other users contributing a total of 100 KSM or more.


### Early Participation Bonuses

Users who participated early on in the Picasso crowdloan received a boost on their earnings: participating in the first 12 hours provided such users with a 5% bonus, and participating in the first three days provided a 10% bonus.
