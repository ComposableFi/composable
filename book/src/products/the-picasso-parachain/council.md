---

Upon launch, governance on Picasso parachain will be done by a Sudo account then 
transition to Council when core pallets have been onboarded. The council is an 
on-chain entity made up of 7 senior team members from Composable Finance and our 
supporters. The council members also control Picasso’s multi-sig wallet. 

When the Picasso parachain is live, each member will be represented as an 
on-chain account on [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpicasso-rpc.composable.finance#/council) 
- Select the Picasso parachain, then Governance, Council. 

As the Picasso community strengthens, community members will play a bigger role 
in governance and Picasso will transition into full democracy. In the meantime, 
the council will safeguard the functioning of the parachain. The council has the 
following responsibilities and privileges: 

* Fastrack proposals 

* Execute administrative tasks such as runtime upgrades, adding assets to 
  bridges

must be in favor (at least 4 out of the 7 members), with no member exercising a 
veto. Council motions which pass with a strict majority (at least 4 out of the 7 
members).
