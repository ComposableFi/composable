# Council

Upon launch, governance on Picasso parachain will be done by a Sudo account then 
transition to Council when core pallets have been onboarded. The council is an 
on-chain entity made up of 11 senior team members from Composable Finance and our 
supporters. The council members also control Picassoâ€™s multi-sig wallet. 

When the Picasso parachain is live, each member will be represented as an 
on-chain account on [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpicasso-rpc.composable.finance#/council) 
- Select the Picasso parachain, then Governance, Council. 

As the Picasso community strengthens, community members will play a bigger role 
in governance and Picasso will transition into full democracy. In the meantime, 
the council will safeguard the functioning of the parachain.

Council will be able propose simple majority democracy voting. Technical collective will fast track voting and enactment of proposal.
If members of council voted for proposal, then, regardless of stake turnout, proposal will be enacted.
This allows council to add relayers and upgrade runtime.

Council majority will be able to add cross chain assets without democracy, so democracy can do that too.

For a referendum to be proposed by the council, a strict majority of members 
must be in favor (at least 6 out of the 11 members), with no member exercising a 
veto. Council motions which pass with a strict majority (at least 6 out of the 11 
members).
