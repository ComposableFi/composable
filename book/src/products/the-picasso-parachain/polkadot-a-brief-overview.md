# Polkadot - A Brief Overview

---

A TL;DR explainer of the Polkadot infrastructure

Sometimes referred to as the ‘blockchain of blockchains’, Polkadot is an 
interoperable ecosystem built on [Substrate](https://www.parity.io/blog/what-is-substrate/). 
It allows cross-chain interoperability and communication beyond just token 
transactions. As an open-source project led by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/), 
Polkadot’s mission is to achieve a completely decentralized web where users are 
in complete control and ownership of their data and identity. Composed of 
various components, including the Relay Chain, parachains, parathreads, and 
bridges, Polkadot enables developers to create interoperable dApps on top of 
parachains that support smart contracts.

The Relay Chain is at the core of the Polkadot protocol and is responsible for 
network [interoperability](https://academy.moralis.io/blog/blockchain-interoperability-and-why-it-matters-for-mass-adoption) 
and shared network security. Moreover, the Relay Chain secures the parachains 
and parathreads within Polkadot’s ecosystem, using the “hub-and-spoke” model. 
[Parachains](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains) are 
independent blockchains on Polkadot/Kusama that are interoperable with each 
other and connect to external networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum via bridges. 
These parachains can mint their own tokens and are customizable to facilitate 
individual use cases. On the other hand, parathreads are smaller, 
‘pay-as-you-go’ models of blockchains that don’t need continuous connectivity 
with the Polkadot network. Bridges allow both parachains and parathreads to 
connect to other blockchains such as [Ethereum](https://academy.moralis.io/blog/ethereum-2-0-beacon-chain-phase-0-and-eth-staking) 
or Bitcoin.
