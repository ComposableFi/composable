# Bug Bounty Via Immunefi

**For transparency, we are continuing to publicize the parachain vault approach 
we took when bidding for a Kusama parachain. This strategy is no longer being 
implemented to support Kusama parachian procurement, as this milestone has 
already been achieved. Please note that the information in italicized text below 
is outdated for this reason:**

*To ensure the security of the novel vault strategy for securing a parachain 
slot, Composable is kicking off a bug bounty program hosted through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/), 
a crypto-focused bug bounty platform to make crypto space more secure and easier 
to navigate.*

*The bug bounty hunters will be incentivized for identifying bugs and other 
vulnerabilities in the codebase of our vaults in our parachain procurement 
strategy. A total of 150,000 USDC and 0.05% of the Composable Token supply will 
be set aside for bounty rewards for identified vulnerabilities in the vault 
codebase.*

*Each escalated bug report will be reviewed by the Composable team, and the bug 
bounty hunters will be rewarded with the amount proportional to the severity of 
the bug or underlying vulnerability, as determined by [Immunefiâ€™s severity 
system](https://immunefi.com/severity-system/). Immunefi will later post all the 
critical bug identification and fixes on their [Medium](https://medium.com/immunefi) 
blog for public availability.*

*The Composable bug bounty is now available at [immunefi.com/bounty/composablefinance](https://immunefi.com/bounty/composablefinance/) 
and will be open indefinitely. We want to ensure our community and vault 
participants that our protocol is protected against nefarious actions, and that 
the community will be rewarded for helping us with this process through this bug 
bounty program.*

*Immunefi has a strong reputation and is one of the leading DeFi bug bounty 
organizations. The platform has helped protocols avert over $1B in hack-related 
damages and has paid out more than $3M in bounties. Immunefi has been trusted by 
major Defi platforms such as [SushiSwap](https://www.sushi.com/), [Cream](https://app.cream.finance/), 
[Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), and [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), to 
name just a few.*
