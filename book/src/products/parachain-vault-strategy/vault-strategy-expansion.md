# Vault Strategy Expansion for the Composable Polkadot Prachain

---

Given our successful procurement of our Kusama parachain, Picasso, we adapted our parachain vault strategy effort to support our Polkadot parachain procurement at auction, and extending the strategy until we earned our Polkadot parachain. 

Composable currently has several vault strategies available on [strategies.composable.finance](https://strategies.composable.finance), for the purposes of supporting the Polkadot crowdloan. However, we are expanding this strategy through our experimental and research arm, [Composable Labs](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/introducing-composable-labs-an-incubator-and-testing-ground-for-projects-using-composables-tech-b467d438142c).

Projects incubated by Composable Labs now have the option to utilize Composable’s existing vault strategies to propel traction and token holders, ahead of their own respective product launches.

## Additional Incentivizations for our Existing Vault Strategies

Our team at Composable created the [Parachain Vault Strategy](../parachain-vault-strategy.html) as a unique way to incentivize user contributions to the tokens needed for obtaining a parachain at auction. These strategies provide users with a yield, exposure to our parachain auction, and LAYR, as the first set of strategies spanning both the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems. As Composable Labs has been active in the incubation of projects utilizing Composable’s stack, and given that the current strategies have a large user base, we realized that it would make sense to give our earliest contributors and community members access to projects incubated by Composable Labs. That’s why we at Composable will begin offering vault strategy stakers tokens from projects incubated by Composable Labs, which is mutually beneficial for the following reasons:

1. Stakers will be able to get upside from the ecosystem that Composable is building, as well as their current earnings in LAYR.

2. Our incubation projects will now have an initial token holder base that will allow them to galvanize initial support as they go to market and ramp up for full releases.

Composable is excited to be offering this to our long-time community supporters. We have additional strategies planned, as well as further projects and collaborations in the pipeline, expanding our ecosystem and supporting mission aligned partners. Furthermore, the NFTs that we have previously announced will be awarded to Mosaic users, will be used to boost yield on these upcoming strategies.

## Updates to Our Vault Offering

### Instrumental Finance and the STRM Token
We are delighted that [Instrumental Finance](https://www.instrumental.finance/), a project utilizing Composable’s tech stack to [bridge sharded applications](https://medium.com/@instrumentalfinance/instrumental-finance-a-cross-layer-cross-chain-lp-position-arbitrage-protocol-50783d753fa5), will be the commencing project to incentivize our vault strategy stakers.

Instrumental Finance is eager to begin tapping into the user base that Composable has built, and is interested in commencing incentivization of the vaults starting at 3pm CET, October 18th, 2021.

*The incentivization program is as follows:*

- Instrumental Finance’s total Instrumental Token (STRM) supply is 100m tokens, with an initial FDV of $30m.
- The program will run for 8 weeks, during which time 5% of Instrumental token (INST) will be distributed.
- During the first 7 days, 3,250,000 tokens will be distributed. Afterwards, the second week will see 1,500,000 tokens distributed. Thereafter for the remainder of the program, there will be 250,000 tokens distributed, with the Instrumental team deciding if they’d like to extend the program thereafter.

Composable is excited to be offering this to our long-time community supporters. We have additional strategies planned, as well as further projects and collaborations in the pipeline, expanding our ecosystem and supporting mission aligned partners. Furthermore, the NFTs that we have previously announced will be awarded to Mosaic users, will be used to boost yield on these upcoming strategies.

### Angular Finance and the ANGL Token
[Angular Finance](https://www.angular.finance/), a joint venture between HydraDX and Composable Finance, is set to leverage our existing vault strategies to generate traction and distribute its native tokens — ANGL.

Built in the Kusama ecosystem, Angular Finance is an isolated lending pair pallet that allows users to pool any two assets. One of the assets serves as collateral to the other. Although similar to popular pool-based lending platforms such as [Aave](https://aave.com/), Angular distinguishes itself with its risk isolation functionality, allowing users to risk the assets in the pool they are participating in instead of the entire platform. With Angular being a Substrate-based pallet, developers can leverage Angular in their dApps and protocols to utilize its advanced security and functionality and native cross-chain communication capabilities.

After a successful program with the Instrumental Finance team, our latest incubation, Angular Finance is taking on this opportunity to distribute a portion of its token supply to stakers in the Composable vault strategies.

With support from Composable’s community, Angular Finance began incentivizing the vaults starting at 13.00pm CET on December 6, 2021.

**Below are details of the incentivization program:**

- Angular Finance’s total token supply is 100m tokens, with an initial FDV of $25m
- The program will run for eight weeks, during which time 5% of ANGL tokens will be distributed.
- During the first 7 days, 3,250,000 tokens will be distributed. The following week will see the distribution of 1,500,000 tokens, and the remaining duration of the program will see 250,000 tokes distributed.
- Although there are no existing plans to extend the program beyond this duration, the Angular team will relay necessary information if required.

## How it Works

Existing stakers will not need to do anything to be earning STRM or ANGL tokens. Rather, they just need to stake in the vault, and can transparently view the APY they are earning. New stakers in the vaults will commence earning STRM or ANGL tokens immediately upon entering the vault after it was opened.
