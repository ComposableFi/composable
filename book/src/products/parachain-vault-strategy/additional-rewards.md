# Vault Boosts

--- 

**For transparency, we are continuing to publicize the parachain vault approach 
we took when bidding for a Kusama parachain. This strategy is no longer being 
implemented to support Kusama parachian procurement, as this milestone has 
already been achieved. Please note that the information in italicized text below 
is outdated for this reason:**

*0.7% of the Composable (LAYR) token will be distributed throughout our 
parachain strategyâ€™s third week, after vault caps are lifted.*

*Additionally, we are providing further incentives for participating for another 
90 days. Thus, we reward users for their assistance in helping us continue to 
procure the KSM/DOT tokens needed for obtaining a Kusama or Polkadot parachain 
at auction.*

*Rewards will be available across the 90 day period, with incentives being 
concentrated earlier in the time frame.*

*In the first 10 days of our parachain vault strategy extension, we will be 
distributing 780,000 LAYR tokens as rewards. In the subsequent 40 days, we will 
then allocate a total of 1,500,000 LAYR tokens as rewards. Then, in the final 40 
days of this vault strategy extension, we will reward users with 100,000 LAYR 
tokens. These tokens will be vested over 1 year.*
