# Risks

**For transparency, we are continuing to publicize the parachain vault approach 
we took when bidding for a Kusama parachain. This strategy is no longer being 
implemented to support Kusama parachian procurement, as this milestone has 
already been achieved. Please note that the information in italicized text below 
is outdated for this reason:**

*Parachain vault strategies provide an annual percentage yield (APY) for users 
who invest and at the same time gives ETH or stable coin holders exposure to 
KSM/DOT auctions, opening gates that were chained shut in the past.*

*Opportunities for yield farming have inherent risks associated with them. 
Please take note of the following risks associated with our solution:*

## *Smart Contract Related Risks*

*Even though smart contracts are known for being a stable and a secure way of 
processing data, bugs can still be discovered.*

*Attempted remediation for this risk includes the following:*

* *Trail of Bits audited our solution and changes have been reviewed by Stela 
  Labs.*

* *Our cap for the vault will slowly be increased over time.*

* *Composable’s contracts themselves don’t keep users’ funds, rather re-routing 
  them to yield farms that have several thousand users associated with them.*

## *Market Related Risk*

*The fluctuation of assets is also an obvious market-related concern. Our 
strategies, depending on the one you chose to invest into, might swap your 
initial asset to another. In case of a withdrawal, that asset is swapped back to 
your initial one. The amount you receive back plus the APY depends on the price 
variation between the initial asset and the under the hood asset.*

*Remediation for this risk includes the following:*

* *We tackle this risk by providing a boosted APY generated by Composable 
  Tokens, which are distributed at the token generation event (TGE) and after 
  the launch event.*

* *Each strategy will illustrate exactly what happens under the hood in order 
  for users to determine for themselves if they are comfortable taking on a 
  given level of risk.*

* *To further mitigate market risk, all the strategies supported through 
  Composable use assets with high liquidity in most AMMs, making it harder for 
  people to manipulate them.*

## *Yield Farms' Related Risks*

*All the risks associated with any dApp are also available in the case of yield 
farming through Composable.*

*Remediation for this risk includes the following:*

* *In order to have a high APY and a higher degree of stability, we chose to 
  connect to farms that were proven to be strong performers so far.*
