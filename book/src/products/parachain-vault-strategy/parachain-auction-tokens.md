# Parachain Auction Tokens

**For transparency, we are continuing to publicize the parachain vault approach 
we took when bidding for a Kusama parachain. This strategy is no longer being 
implemented to support Kusama parachian procurement, as this milestone has 
already been achieved. Please note that the information in italicized text below 
is outdated for this reason:**

*Parachain Auction Tokens (or pAT) are the receipt token minted for 
participation in our parachain vault strategy, representing a user’s stake in 
the vault. Whenever someone deposits in our vault, they get back pAT in an 
amount depending upon their investment and strategy type.*

*If we take Harvest stablecoins strategies as an example, whenever you invest 
Token (Dai/Usdc/Usdt), you’ll get back fToken (fDai/fUsdc/fUsdt). The value of 
fToken is usually a bit lower than the amount of token you invested.*

*For example, investing $100 in DAI in the Harvest DAI strategy will get you 
around 95 fDai, and the amount of pAT you’ll receive is equal to the amount of 
fDai, which is 95 in this case.*

*Each strategy has its own pAT token, similar to how an AMM transfers LP tokens 
once you add liquidity.*

*One of the use cases for pAT is to mint EQLC (our stablecoin). In DeFi, when 
you make an investment, your funds are locked until you withdraw, so we’ve come 
up with the idea to mint EQLC and use that as an alternative to your initial 
funds.*

*A future usage of pAT tokens will also be to obtain Composable Tokens by 
staking them into a vault-type contract, which will be available after TGE.*
