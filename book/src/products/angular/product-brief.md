# Product Brief

Business objective
------------------

We believe that to support the fast-moving and creative spirit of the Kusama ecosystem, a protocol like Angular is a necessary primitive in order to allow other teams to build and experiment with further DeFi primitives that utilize leverage.


---

Why is this important right now?
--------------------------------

Complex applications and products are coming to Kusama

*   Sophisticated financial tools are readily available in centralized finance
*   Building blocks with the ability to leverage lending protocols to create these financial tools in DeFi are crucial for a broader adoption of DeFi.


What are we solving for?
------------------------

Angular Finance - an isolated lending pair pallet, designed to isolate risk and set to open new opportunities for use cases such as:

*   Leverage on interest bearing assets
*   Lending protocol for leveraged trading, options, and derivatives
*   Generating yield from any asset
