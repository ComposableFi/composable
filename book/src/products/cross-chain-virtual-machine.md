# Cross-Chain Virtual Machine

The Composable XCVM allows for cross-ecosystem communication.

--- 

The Composable Cross Chain Virtual Machine (XCVM) is a single, developer friendly interface to interact orchestrate smart contract functions across the multitude of L1 and L2 networks available. In short, the XCVM serves to abstract complexity from the process of having to send instructions to the routing layer directly, initiate call-backs into smart contracts, and more.
