# Single-Sided Staking

---

Mosaic allows for ‘single-sided staking’, where users earn yield by providing liquidity for one type of asset, in contrast to liquidity provisioning on AMMs which requires a pair of assets. Mosaic’s rebalancing mechanism can move liquidity across chains using bridges, thereby allowing users to gain from transfers outside of the chains they originally provide liquidity on. 

Active liquidity also enables single-sided staking: active liquidity is provided when a user makes a request to transfer an amount of tokens greater than the available liquidity and another user provides liquidity for that transfer. This can be compared to the way orders are filled on TradFi exchanges, where orders are seen and then filled only after being specifically identified and met by a provider.
