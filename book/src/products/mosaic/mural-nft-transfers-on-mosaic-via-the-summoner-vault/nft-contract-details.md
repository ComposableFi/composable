## Functions

```
function transferERC721ToLayer( 
    address sourceNFTAddress,
    uint256 sourceNFTId,
    address destinationAddress,
    uint256 destinationNetworkID,
    uint256 transferDelay,
    address feeToken
)
```

This function emits `TransferInitiated` with `isRelease == true` if the NFT is to be released on the destination network. This is a special case when the original network of the NFT is equal to the destination network. On receiving this event the relayer has to call the `releaseSeal` method on the destination layer.

This function emits `TransferInitiated` with `isRelease == false` when the NFT is being transferred to a destination network other than the original network of the NFT. `TransferInitiated` event contains the information about the original NFT which is needed in the `summonNFT` method. On receiving this event the relayer has to call the `summonNFT` method on the destination layer.

```
function releaseSeal(
    address nftOwner,
    address nftContract,
    uint256 nftId,
    bytes32 id,
    bool isFailure
)
```

This method is called in two cases:

1. To release the original NFT on the original network. The boolean `isFailure` is false. 
2. To release the source NFT on the source network in case of a failed transfer. The boolean `isFailure` is true.

```
summonNFT(
    string memory nftUri,
    address destinationAddress,
    address originalNftAddress,
    uint256 originalNetworkID,
    uint256 originalNftId,
    bytes32 id
)
```

This method is called to create/transfer a MosaicNFT on the destination network.

## NFT Transfer Flow

### Transfer to destination layer 

- User calls `transferERC721ToLayer` on source layer -> `TransferInitiated` event with `isRelease == false`
- Relayer reads the event on source layer and calls `summonNFT` on destination layer
- MosaicNFT is minted/transferred on destination layer 

### Transfer back to original layer 

- User calls `transferERC721ToLayer` on the original layer with minted NFT -> `TransferInitiated` event with `isRelease == true`
- Relayer reads the event and calls `releaseSeal` on original layer with `isFailure == false`
- Original NFT is transferred back to the user 

### Failed transfer to destination layer 

- User calls `transferERC721ToLayer` on source layer -> `TransferInitiated` event
- Relayer fails to transfer the NFT to destination layer 
- Relayer calls `releaseSeal` on the source with `isFailure == true`
