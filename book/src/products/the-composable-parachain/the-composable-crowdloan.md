# The Composable Crowdloan

Our crowdloan on Polkadot was critical in allowing us to successfully obtain the 
8th Polkadot parachain slot during the 7th round of auctions of these 
parachains. Over 9 thousand users participated in our crowdloan, depositing a 
total of 6,075,485 DOT (a value of over $163 million).

**For transparency, we are continuing to publicize the crowdloan approach we took 
when bidding for a Polkadot parachain. Please note that the information in 
italicized text below is outdated for this reason:**

*Our crowdloan strategy improved upon existing crowdloans by offering augmented 
flexibility and earning opportunities for users, such as the [depositing of 
stablecoins](https://composablefi.medium.com/composable-enables-participation-in-the-picasso-crowdloan-using-erc-20-stablecoins-launching-aab49c965a1a) 
and [enhanced incentives](https://composablefi.medium.com/our-picasso-crowdloan-plans-for-future-kusama-auctions-8cda80d71208) 
for participants. For our Polkadot crowdloan, participation was capped at 25 
million DOT.*

*This crowdloan was available on our [app](https://crowdloan.composable.finance/). 
Users were able to stake stablecoins or DOT, earn an APY on their stakings, and 
support the ever-growing Composable ecosystem. Our Polkadot crowdloan went live 
within a few days of its announcement, allowing users to bid in the second 
batch.*

## *Rewards*

***We initially offered 12% of LAYR supply to crowdloan contributors, 
with 25% vesting on TGE, and the remainder vesting over 1.5 years. As the amount 
staked in our crowdloan continues to accumulate, we have designated additional 
awards to be unlocked according to the same vesting schedule, amounting to a 
total of 14% of the LAYR token supply.***

*See a breakdown of our early bird incentives for this initial 12%:*

* *5% bonus to those who staked in the first 24 hours*

* *5% bonus to those who previously contributed KSM and stablecoins to the 
  Picasso Crowdloan*

* *10% bonus to stakers in the first three days of opening the crowdloan*

* *20% bonus for those who refer a total of 1000 DOT using our referral codes*

*Additionally, [we announced an increase](https://composablefi.medium.com/christmas-comes-early-for-crowdloan-contributors-30-increase-in-rewards-ffc11c911af7) 
in the rewards for Composable crowdloan stakers. These added rewards come on top 
of the above early bird incentives.*

*The timing for this increase in rewards aligns perfectly with the Composable 
crowdloan having recently reached the milestone of over [3 million DOT](https://medium.com/composable-finance/composable-finance-on-pace-with-3m-polkadot-contributed-5576c14716e1) 
staked.*

***We decided that, if we passed the 4 million DOT staked mark, we would add an 
additional 2% of total LAYR supply to crowdloan contributors. We ended up 
significantly surpassing this milestone, thus unlocking these additional 
rewards.***

***With the extra 2% increase thus unlocked, it means we increased our total 
LAYR supply distributed to crowdloan supporters from 12% to 14%.***

*As [stated in a previous article](https://composablefi.medium.com/composable-enables-participation-in-the-picasso-crowdloan-using-erc-20-stablecoins-launching-aab49c965a1a#:~:text=PICA%20rewards%20will%20be%20distributed%20to%20Polkadot.js%20wallets%20through%20a%20claim%20process.), 
we will also be issuing PICA rewards through a claim process to members who 
participated with stablecoins during our Picasso crowdloan. The claim process is 
scheduled to take place before Composableâ€™s LAYR tokens are distributed, so that 
prior crowdloan participants will be recognized during the distribution of 
rewards of LAYR.*
