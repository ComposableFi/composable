# fNFT use cases

CHAOS fNFTs, through their composability, allow the underlying assets to remain locked, but allow the representative token to continue to be used. As such, CHAOS token holders are actively able to earn yield and use their fNFT for other means, such as governance, while ultimately being able to burn their fNFT at the end of the locked period and return rewards.

CHAOS fNFTs can also be used as collateral for lending and leveraged trading, and to be traded on secondary marketplaces. This unlocks a new avenue of profit-making for CHAOS holders and dramatically increases the utility of the fNFTs.


## Bonding and distribution of fNFTs as ecosystem rewards

CHAOS fNFTs allows users to be rewarded without the creation of high inflationary pressures on native tokens. For example, farming incentives can be distributed as fNFTs to reward Pablo users, without the need to mint and endless give out Pablo tokens, diluting their price and value.


## Collator Staking

We will further implement that locked PICA is not sitting idle in the treasury and is used for collator staking. The value generated through this will therefore flow back as yield to CHAOS fNFT holders through the existing model. The CHAOS, therefore, becomes not only the yield-bearing boosted version of PICA but also becomes the equivalent of a liquid staking derivative too once our collator staking feature is implemented. Through various streams of revenue and governance value drivers, CHAOS will allow us to distribute rewards from income rather than inflation.


## Governance through fNFTs

Once governance on Picasso is live, CHAOS holders will be able vote on governance decisions. Ultimately, this means users will be able to incentivize and direct liquidity across different protocols on the Picasso ecosystem. 


## Liquidity Gauges

In the future, Picasso liquidity gauges will be established that direct liquidity incentives from the Picasso treasury. This will establish where liquidity is allocated, and establish additional governance utility for the CHAOS fNFTs. New protocols being established on Picasso, for example, will be incentivized to bribe CHAOS holders in order to direct liquidity to bootstrap their protocol.

# Overview of CHAOS for a user

---

* Users will lock PICA for varying lengths of time to receive CHAOS, with longer locks receiving proportionally more rewards.
* Users holding CHAOS will earn yield in the form of PICA, incubated tokens, and from various other streams such as collator staking, protocol revenue, and treasury revenue.
* Users will be able to claim token rewards as they are vested, being able to compound these back onto their original fNFT by relocking.
* Once the time-lock has finished, users will simply redeem their initial PICA or choose to renew their lock.
* Minting the CHAOS position as an fNFT opens up significant opportunities for further utility of financial NFTs whilst ensuring the underlying tokens are locked, namely through collateralisation and secondary market trading.
* Holding the CHAOS fNFTs will initially entitle users to rewards, but most importantly will play a key role in the management and direction of treasury assets.

## Rough Notes


## What is CHAOS?


## What are fNFTs, and why is CHAOS an fNFT?

Financial NFTs (fNFTs) are a form of tokenization that allows composability and utility within DeFi ecosystems. The more widely used VE tokens, which function as receipts for locked assets, do not provide this functionality.

The use of fNFTs will eventually become the standard across all of Composable’s Substrate protocol tokens


## How CHAOS fNFTs improve the Picasso Treasury

One of the definitive features of the Picasso treasury is protocol-owned liquidity, to overcome the challenge of mercenary capital for different Picasso protocols. The use of CHAOS fNFTs strengthens this process. The Picasso treasury will directly be able to directly offer bonds for CHAOS tokens. These bonds will be for longer time periods, which means longer-term locks, and resultantly deeper liquidity.

The impact of CHAOS on the Picasso treasury will have multiple second and third order effects which will filter back into improved returns for CHAOS holders. Trading fees that the Picasso treasury earns will be provided as an additional stream of yield returns to CHAOS holders. The deepened liquidity in the ecosystem will mean higher network activity, which will further increase return on network fees.

## Controlling inflationary pressures of incubated tokens

CHAOS fNFTs allows users to be rewarded without the creation of high inflationary pressures on native tokens. For example, farming incentives can be distributed as fNFTs to reward Pablo users, without the need to mint and endless give out Pablo tokens, diluting their price and value.


## CHAOS will play a vital role in treasury management

CHAOS fNFTs will play a significant role in governing how the Picasso treasury is allocated and managed. In the future, fNFT holders will propose and direct funds to increase and incentivize liquidity across Picasso protocols. This will also enable the creation of Picasso gauges that determine where liquidity is allocated, thereby establishing strong governance dynamics for fNFT holders. For example, a new protocol launching on Picasso will have the ability to bribe CHAOS holders to receive incentives in the form of $PICA, as well as total value locked (TVL) in the form of POL.

CHAOS will play a significant role in governing how the treasury is allocated and managed. In the future, CHAOS holders will propose and direct funds to increase and incentivise liquidity across the various Picasso protocols. This opens the door to creating Picasso gauges that determine where liquidity is allocated, thereby establishing strong governance dynamics for the CHAOS fNFT that adds additional value and utility. For example, a new protocol launching on Picasso will therefore then have the ability to acquire or bribe CHAOS holders in order to receive incentives in the form of PICA, as well as TVL in the form of protocol owned liquidity.


## How does the Treasury Acquire tokens?

Picasso will own its own incubated protocol tokens, directed from Composable Labs tokens (projects that are incubated by Composable labs, such as Angular, give a portion of their supply to the Picasso treasury). The treasury will actively provide liquidity and earn yields on its holdings by directing funds to a pool to help bootstrap that pool. The first protocol to launch on is Picasso — Pablo, the next-gen Substrate DEX. The PBLO token will be 100% community-owned and bought at a discount through bonding LPs.


## How does the treasury get yield?

Unlike many other protocols, the Picasso protocol earns yield on its own protocol owned assets, network fees and revenue from its incubated protocols. This model ensures that Picasso retains, manages, and distributes back to token holders through CHAOS fNFTs. Whilst Picasso generates revenue from the onset of its launch, bonds will be used to grow the treasury, specifically focusing on KSM liquidity, while focusing on creating a sustainable CHAOS inflation schedule from launch. Users will be able to stake CHAOS for significant yield opportunities that are currently not available in Kusama. In short, CHAOS allows an effective way for growing the Picasso treasury and distributing yield generated, whilst additionally avoiding the selling of protocol owned funds. In other words, Picasso will get yield from: 

* LP fees
* Network fees
* Protocol revenue
* Transaction fees
* Emissions
