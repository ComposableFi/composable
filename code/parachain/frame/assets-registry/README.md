# Overview

Allows to map remote assets to local identifiers and back(bidirectional). 

Foreign mapping can be created only by privileged origin.

Also provides some assets metadata for humans to consume offchain.

Well known tokens, like relay and native, are baked into codebase directly.

Governance can change any token info. 

Some assets has admins for various parts to allow self governance which is still safe and secure.
