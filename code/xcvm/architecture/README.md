# Architecture

This directory contains more in-depth writing on the XCVM architecture, with implementation-specific specifications, as well as addendums to the [spec](../SPEC.md). Even though the writings here should provide a comprehensive overview of the actual system, code-is-law and the actual implementation defines the behavior as of now. Use the source, Luke!
