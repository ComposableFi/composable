## XCVM Contracts state


### State

```mermaid
erDiagram
    XC-ACCOUNT {        
        coin[] some_funds
        address xc
    }
    OFFCHAIN_WALLET {
        string private_key
    }
    XC {
        program[] programs
        address[][] wallets
        address[] xc_accounts  
        coin[] all_funds
    }
    BRIDGE }|..|| XC : callback_or_call
    XC ||--o{ XC-ACCOUNT : delegate
    XC-ACCOUNT ||--o{ DEX: swap
    OFFCHAIN_WALLET }|..|| XC-ACCOUNT : manage
    OFFCHAIN_WALLET }|..|| XC : execute  
```

### Execution

Program execution touches the following components in this approximate manner:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant C as Contract
   participant I as Interpreter   
   participant R as Router
   participant G as Gateway
   participant B as Bridge

   C->>I: Dispatch Program.
   I->>R: Route exiting message.
   R->>G: Send message.
   Note over R,G: Select appropriate bridge based on Program.
   G->>B: Transfer funds and send message.
```

For brevity, the receiving side of the chain has been omitted, although that goes through similar steps, but for the on-chain components in reverse order.

## Tech

Can be considered as 3 layers,

1. Full deployment of contract with all capabilities. Can do anything.
2. Partial fulfillment of XCVM spec using on chain features in case not deployment is possible (usually can multi hop transfer, swap). 
3. Edges which may start or terminate XCVM programs, but do not execute anything except simple sings (like one hop final transfer) 

For each chain and protocol it makes pragmatics hacks to use existing liquidity and execution primitives.

### ICS-20 Memo as `Spawn` carrier

`Spawn` forms `ICS-20` packet with `memo`.

`Assets` are put into `ICS-20` packet.

`Assets` are sent to `xc-account` contract, and  `wasm` termination callback is done to `xc` master contract with sender info and `Spawn` body.

`Memo` wasm message contains information to verify check sender from hash. 

`xc-master` contract verifies amount sent and proceed with move of assets up to amount in message via delegation from `xc-account`. 

Approach is needed because there is no `amount` information can be securely transferred in `memo`.
