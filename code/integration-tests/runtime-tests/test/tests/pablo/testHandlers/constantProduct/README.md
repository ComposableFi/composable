# Premade weighted math code by Balancer

Balancer released publicly usable TypeScript code for the constant product math formulas.

We're using these instead of writing our own to avoid potential problems,
and who wants to reinvent the wheel anyway.

The only adjustment made, are 2 imports on `weightedMath.ts`.
To align with our folder structure.
