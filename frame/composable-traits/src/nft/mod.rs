//! Default interface is used to interact with financial NFTs through a NFT provider.
//!
//! Allows to enter positions and sell it before position is left as NFT.
//! Allows to split financial positions.
//!
//! # Design
//! There are 2 ways to integrate NFT and financial positions.
//!
//! Store all metadata of position in NFT BLOB or store only reference in NFT.
//!
//! What we have in case of storing reference:
//! - NFT account produced from identity is set as owner of position
//! - protocol providing position implements trait which allow to work with it through NFT API
//! - position is stored in any way efficient for that
//! - NFT stores only reference to position in protocol,
//! For example, pallet identifier and some strict monotonic a counter/sequence identifier of
//! position combined.
//! - allows to build NFTs from typed positions(primitives)
//! - during XCMP transfer, owner of NFT become target parachain
//! - position reference work well with reserver transfer XCMP approach
//!
//! So NFT is (class, id, position reference)
//!
//!
//! In case of storing all data in NFT(as serde binary):
//! - protocol calls NFT to read state
//! - storage is not maximally efficient
//! - more risks of having serde issue and types
//!
//! In both cases can XCMPing NFT state as whole requires protocol constraints, like immutability or
//! protocol implementation on other side. In both cases RPC or shared library is required to
//! interpret state offchain.
//!
//! Problem with traditional NFTs - these are isolated from each other while burn and mint, while
//! our goal is to make burn/mint(and split) to influence some total/shared.  For this case we go
//! with option to have a proxy which ensure that NFT part of state and protocol state are
//! synchronized during such calls.
