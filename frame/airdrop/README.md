# Airdrop

The Airdrop pallet enables the granting of tokens to a set of users.

## Overview

The airdrop pallet is a generalization of the crowdloan pallet, allowing users 
and protocols to airdrop tokens to users. It differs from the crowdloan pallet 
in that it supports multiple concurrent airdrops, instead of a single one.
