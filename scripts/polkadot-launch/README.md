# Run Composable's parachain only

Need to do to run 4 relay chain nodes and 1 Composable's collator:

1. build a Composable's collator

	```bash
	old_pwd=$(pwd)
	cd ../..
	cargo build --release
	target/release/composable --version
	cd "$old_pwd"
    ```

2. download a Polkadot Relay Chain

	```bash
	mkdir -p ../../../polkadot/target/release
	curl https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/download/v0.9.17/polkadot -Lo ../../../polkadot/target/release/polkadot
	../../../polkadot/target/release/polkadot -- version
    ```

3. build this project

	```bash
	yarn
	```

4. run all

	```bash
	yarn composable
	```

URLs:
* `https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9945#/explorer` is the 1st Relay Chain node
* `https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9988#/explorer` is the 1st Composable's collator
