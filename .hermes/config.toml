# This is an example configuration for Hermes. It is meant to be
# used as a reference, _NOT_ for configuring a production relayer. 
# If you're looking to configure a production relayer for some chains, 
# try using the `hermes config auto` command to generate a config 
# file that serves as the starting point for configuring Hermes.

# The global section has parameters that apply globally to the relayer operation.
[global]

# Specify the verbosity for the relayer logging output. Default: 'info'
# Valid options are 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug', 'trace'.
log_level = 'debug'


# Specify the mode to be used by the relayer. [Required]
[mode]

# Specify the client mode.
[mode.clients]

# Whether or not to enable the client workers. [Required]
enabled = true

# Whether or not to enable periodic refresh of clients. [Default: true]
# This feature only applies to clients that underlie an open channel.
# For Tendermint clients, the frequency at which Hermes refreshes them is 2/3 of their
# trusting period (e.g., refresh every ~9 days if the trusting period is 14 days).
# Note: Even if this is disabled, clients will be refreshed automatically if
#      there is activity on a connection or channel they are involved with.
refresh = true

# Whether or not to enable misbehaviour detection for clients. [Default: true]
misbehaviour = true

# Specify the connections mode.
[mode.connections]

# Whether or not to enable the connection workers for handshake completion. [Required]
enabled = true

# Specify the channels mode.
[mode.channels]

# Whether or not to enable the channel workers for handshake completion. [Required]
enabled = true

# Specify the packets mode.
[mode.packets]

# Whether or not to enable the packet workers. [Required]
enabled = true

# Parametrize the periodic packet clearing feature.
# Interval (in number of blocks) at which pending packets
# should be periodically cleared. A value of '0' will disable
# periodic packet clearing. [Default: 100]
clear_interval = 100

# Whether or not to clear packets on start. [Default: true]
clear_on_start = true

# Toggle the transaction confirmation mechanism.
# The tx confirmation mechanism periodically queries the `/tx_search` RPC
# endpoint to check that previously-submitted transactions
# (to any chain in this config file) have been successfully delivered.
# If they have not been, and `clear_interval = 0`, then those packets are
# queued up for re-submission.
# If set to `false`, the following telemetry metrics will be disabled:
# `acknowledgment_packets_confirmed`, `receive_packets_confirmed` and `timeout_packets_confirmed`.
# [Default: false]
tx_confirmation = false

# The REST section defines parameters for Hermes' built-in RESTful API.
# https://hermes.informal.systems/rest.html
[rest]

# Whether or not to enable the REST service. Default: false
enabled = false

# Specify the IPv4/6 host over which the built-in HTTP server will serve the RESTful
# API requests. Default: 127.0.0.1
host = '127.0.0.1'

# Specify the port over which the built-in HTTP server will serve the restful API
# requests. Default: 3000

# The telemetry section defines parameters for Hermes' built-in telemetry capabilities.
# https://hermes.informal.systems/telemetry.html
[telemetry]

# Whether or not to enable the telemetry service. Default: false
enabled = false

# Specify the IPv4/6 host over which the built-in HTTP server will serve the metrics
# gathered by the telemetry service. Default: 127.0.0.1
host = '127.0.0.1'

# Specify the port over which the built-in HTTP server will serve the metrics gathered
# by the telemetry service. Default: 3001
