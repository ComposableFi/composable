# Software Dependencies

Adding a dependency is a legal risk.
For 2, if you are unsure of the legal implications, contact our general council through the maintainers/your team lead. 

Exact version of dependencies are more welcomed than wildcards(*).

We pin to a `commit`, not a branch for git dependencies. 
Forks with PRs to upstream are welcomed, forks without PRs to upstream are not.

Other things are checked by CI jobs or decided per case.
