# Picasso Fork off substrate

This is based on [fork-off-substrate script](https://github.com/maxsam4/fork-off-substrate) to support parachain forks while also adding some modifications specific to Picasso parachain.

This script allows bootstrapping a new substrate chain with the current state of a live chain. Using this, you can create a fork of Picasso for development purposes.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

2. Create a folder called `data` inside the top folder (`fork-off`).

    ```bash
    mkdir data
    ```

3. Build the executable/binary of the currently live Picasso parachain and the runtime wasm. For `picasso-1400` runtime onwards these are listed in the [releases](https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable/releases) page.

    You can build the binary with built-in wasm for the given version by going into the `/code` folder and running the following:

    ```bash
   # go to the /code folder
   cd ../../../code

   # check out the tag, eg: release-v1.10002
    git checkout release-v1.10002

    cargo +nightly build --release -p wasm-optimizer
    cargo +nightly build --release -p dali-runtime-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
    cargo +nightly build --release -p picasso-runtime-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
    cargo +nightly build --release -p composable-runtime-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ./target/release/wasm-optimizer --input ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/dali_runtime.wasm --output ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/dali_runtime.optimized.wasm
   ./target/release/wasm-optimizer --input ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/picasso_runtime.wasm --output ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/picasso_runtime.optimized.wasm
   ./target/release/wasm-optimizer --input ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/composable_runtime.wasm --output ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/composable_runtime.optimized.wasm

    export DALI_RUNTIME=$(realpath ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/dali_runtime.optimized.wasm) && \
   export PICASSO_RUNTIME=$(realpath ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/picasso_runtime.optimized.wasm) && \
   export COMPOSABLE_RUNTIME=$(realpath ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/composable_runtime.optimized.wasm) && \
   cargo build --release --package composable --features=builtin-wasm
    ```
    TODO: Remove this once the release includes the WASM, as it will not be necessary


4. Copy the binary from `target/release/composable` to `fork-off/data` and rename it to `binary`.

    ```bash
     cp ./target/release/composable ../composablejs/packages/fork-off/data/binary
    ```


5. Copy the runtime WASM blob of the Picasso release from `/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/picasso_runtime.optimized.wasm` to `fork-off/data` and rename it to `runtime.wasm`.
    ```bash
    cp ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/picasso_runtime.optimized.wasm ../composablejs/packages/fork-off/data/runtime.wasm
   ```


6. Checkout your working branch


7. Go back to the `fork-off` package (`cd ../composablejs/packages/fork-off`) and run the main script. This will download the right Polkadot version and generate all the necessary files for the new chain.

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
8. On different terminals, run each of these commands:

    ```bash
   make alice
   ```
    ```bash
   make bob
   ```
    ```bash
   make charlie
   ```
    ```bash
   make collator1
   ```
   ```bash
   make collator2
   ```
   The first three will run the relay chain and the last two will run the forked parachain.


9. Download the next version of the Picasso runtime wasm from the [releases](https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable/releases/latest) page, save it in the `/data` folder, and rename it from `picasso_runtime_v****.wasm` to `runtime_upgrade.wasm`. This will be automated soon.


10. Start the runtime upgrade by running

    ```bash
    yarn run upgrade
    ```
    This can take a few minutes from the moment the chain starts producing blocks.
   Once the script is finished, the parachain should be upgraded on the next block. It will run on port `9988` and can be visualized in https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9988#/explorer
