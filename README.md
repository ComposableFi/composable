Composable Finance is dedicated to building the infrastructure for trust-minimized interoperability and decentralised block building for efficient cross-chain execution. Within this repository, you'll find the codebase for Composable Polkadot and Picasso. Additionally, it houses pallets included in their respective runtimes.

Among the noteworthy pallets included are:

- [CosmWasm VM for Substrate](./code/parachain/frame/cosmwasm/)
- [Multihop (XCM + IBC)](./code/parachain/frame/pallet-multihop-xcm-ibc/) 
- [Apollo](./code/parachain/frame/oracle/)
- [Pablo DEX](./code/parachain/frame/pablo/)
- [Liquid staking](./code/parachain/frame/liquid-staking/)

Composable's core technology extends beyond this repository. It includes key components such as [CVM and MANTIS](https://github.com/ComposableFi/cvm), the first IBC implementation on Substrate â€“ [Pallet-ibc](https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable-ibc), the [Composable Cosmos chain](https://github.com/notional-labs/composable-centauri), and [Solana IBC](https://github.com/ComposableFi/emulated-light-client).
