Picasso is our custom built Kusama parachain, based on the substrate framework.

## Install

For linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and macOS:

```sh
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
git clone https://github.com/composableFi/composable
cd composable/
sh scripts/init.sh
cargo build --release
```

or you can simply install it with this one liner:    

```sh
curl https://get.composable.finance | sh
```     


## Run  

Since Composable is now a parachain, you need to run a full relaychain in addition to running Composable.
In order to do so, install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) and use the [polkadot-launch](scripts/polkadot-launch) script.



## Pallets
Picasso ships with multiple custom made pallets such as:
[Cubic Vault](frame/vault/README.md)
[Apollo](frame/oracle/README.md)

and several others you can find in the frame folder.
