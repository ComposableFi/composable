# Decentralized Lending

We've previously covered one major application of DeFi: AMMs and trading. Now we're going to dive a bit deeper into another major application: overcollateralized loans. These protocols are smart contracts, that allow you to borrow tokens for a higher-value asset. For example, you can borrow $400 USDC in exchange for locking up $1000 worth of Bitcoin. As you repay the loan (with interest), your BTC is redeemed. When the value of BTC starts dropping, the protocol will auction off the collateral (BTC), so that it does not lose money.

Using these decentralized lending protocols, we can introduce leverage as a new tool in the DeFi arsenal:

Leverage and lending can be hotly discussed topics. It's possible to increase profits by taking on leverage, but losses are also increased. Our standpoint is that it is merely another tool and, if used properly, a versatile one. However, even in TradFi, leverage affects the markets disproportionally: [Confronting the Hazards of Rising Leverage](https://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/29/confronting-the-hazards-of-rising-leverage/).
