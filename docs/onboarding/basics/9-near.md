# NEAR

The final chain that you need to understand is NEAR, which handles scaling through sharding.

NEAR has a very clever consensus mechanism, which makes it a great candidate for IBC-based bridging as well. We're targeting NEAR as the third bridged ecosystem.

### Takeaways

We're now entering pretty complex topics. Enjoy and try to learn as much as you can, but fully understanding NEAR and Nightshade is not a job requirement, unless you are working on the bridging team.
