# Tech basics

Here you'll find topics to introduce you to many technical blockchain concepts. You'll also find some useful links in case you are already familiar with blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

## Expectations

If you're being onboarded right now as an employee of Composable finance, we expect you to have a good understanding of the following topics after finishing your onboarding:

- Consensus and blockchain
- Smart contracts
- Bridging and cross-chain
- Cryptoassets (erc20, erc721, erc1155, cw20, native assets, LP tokens and more)
- Automated market makers (AMMs)
- Decentralized lending protocols.
- Polkadot (Composable, Acala, Moonbeam)
- Cosmos
- NEAR
- IBC
- XVCM

Some of the other stuff you'll be learning, but not necessarily in your first week, include:

- Zero-knowledge proofs.
- Layer 2 scaling solutions

Depending on your role, the expected level of knowledge will differ, however. For our developers, we expect a solid understanding of the above concepts, including the mathematics, design tradeoffs, and underlying technology. However we feel like everyone in Composable is building together towards a shared vision, and for that, you need to see where we came from, and where we are going. A strong foundation is needed to build a strong community and product.

> *Note*
> DO NOT PANIC. We're here to help.

If you're already familiar with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, each section will contain links to the original research as well as the state-of-the-art progress on each subject. Skip to that and become an expert. 

## Will I stop having to learn after my onboarding?

Never.

## I don't work for Composable, but am a contributor/interested in crypto/passing by

Feel free to have a look at all of our stuff, it's open-source for a reason. We accept contributions. Besides these crypto basics, make sure to check out our docs too.
