# Overview

Runtime testing involves running parachain code to ensure quality.
Unlike type system or static analysis (unluding basic linting).
Here is hierarchy of testing you may find in this parachain

| Name          | Runtime   | Warp | Start from real state | Serde |
| ------------- | --------- | ---- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Unit          | no        | yes  | no                    | no    |
| Runtime Unit  | mock      | yes  | yes                   |
| Property test | mock      | yes  |
| Benchmark     | mock/real | yes  |
| Visualization | no/mock   | yes  |
| Simulation    | real      | yes  | yes                   |
| Simnode       | real      | yes  | yes                   |
| Local Relay   | real      | no   |                       |
| Deployment    | real      | no   |                       |
