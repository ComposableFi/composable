# The Mosaic Pallet

---

Adding Mosaic as a primary 
[pallet](https://composablefi.medium.com/the-pallet-revolution-powered-by-picasso-481377738836) on Picasso will 
bridge assets from the EVM chains that are supported. This enables compatibility with EVM assets for applications built 
on Picasso and would open up opportunities for a range of functionalities such as the following actions:

* Users holding USDC on Polygon can bridge it to Picasso, participate in the Picasso liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP)
  and get $PICA. 
* Using the PICA/USDC pair, they can then provide liquidity in Pablo’s liquidity rush event and get rewarded in PBLO. 
* Finally, they can bond PICA-PBLO, PICA-KSM and PBLO-KSM for PBLO at a discount, which in turn allows Pablo to boost 
  its protocol-owned liquidity.
* Through Kusama’s cross-chain messaging (XCM), users can bridge the assets to other parachains such as Moonriver, 
  Karura, etc., and explore the DEX, gaming, stablecoins, lending/borrowing, and NFT opportunities they have to offer.
