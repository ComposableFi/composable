# Composable Virtual Machine (CVM)

Previously known as XCVM, the Composable Virtual Machine (CVM) allows for cross-domain communication enabled through cross-chain smart contracts. The CVM is by no means a new standard for cross-chain communication, which is already the object of numerous projects, but rather an orchestration layer for protocols connected to [Composable IBC](./composable-ibc.md).

## Summary
With the Composable Virtual Machine (CVM), developers can execute complex cross-chain operations in a single, user-signed transaction. With CVM, you're not restricted to a single blockchain universe. Just like you wouldn't want to be confined to one streaming service for all your entertainment needs, why settle for one blockchain network? CVM offers you a plethora of options, letting your digital assets enjoy the best of all worlds.

Unlike existing iterations of blockchain virtual machines, the CVM does not force applications and smart contracts to 
be deployed onto one particular chain. Instead, the XCVM provides a novel opportunity for applications to be 
**natively cross-chain**. The goal is to facilitate a top-down approach to interoperability and composability instead 
of connecting different pre-existing pieces together.

For users, CVM streamlines your experience by abstracting away complicated terms and protocols. In line with a trust-minimized, non-custodial approach, you own your assets at every step. It's cross-chain asset management, simplified. 

For developers, CVM offers native support for various liquidity markets, asset systems, and even bridges. This makes the CVM the most versatile cross-chain solution available. All you need is to write your program once and watch it execute anywhere, seamlessly. Developers do not have to focus on the complex technicalities required for interoperable transactions. Instead, 
the CVM serves as an orchestration framework for cross-chain communication and function calling across multiple ecosystems. 

## The Importance of the CVM
User transactions and intents need a language for execution across different environments/ecosystems. CVM is the building block that energizes the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol to be able to meet this need.

For example, the CVM enables the ability to move Polkadot’s DOT token to Osmosis, swap to DOT to ETH, move ETH to Ethereum, swap to ETH to USDC, and move funds to Composable’s Cosmos chain. This all occurs in one user-signed transaction, which is expressed in plain English.
