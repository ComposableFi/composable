# Kusama ⬌ Polkadot Bridge

Although Centauri was initially designed as a bridge between DotSama and Cosmos, 
the first implementation will actually be between Kusama and Polkadot. 
This is significant since there is currently no bridge between the two relay chains, 
making this the first IBC bridge outside of the Cosmos ecosystem. 
This development is crucial for both the DotSama and Cosmos communities.

A diagram of this implementation can be found below:

Kusama ⬌ Polkadot bridge utilizing IBC

It is important to note that Centauri's components are shared between the 
Cosmos ⬌ DotSama bridge and the Kusama ⬌ Polkadot bridge. 
This is due to the generalized structure of passing messages through the IBC protocol.

This innovation is especially important for achieving the goals of Kusama, 
which have always been centered on experimentation, user acquisition, and funneling towards the future of DotSama. 
By leveraging the IBC protocol as the main access point for DotSama to the broader crypto ecosystem, 
this bridge allows for greater experimentation and user acquisition, which is crucial for the vision of Kusama.

Additionally, this bridge is a crucial advancement in Polkadot's vision of enabling cross-blockchain transfers of assets,
messages, and smart contracts. By building the first KSM ⬌ DOT bridge,
we can leverage a proven and successful cross-chain communication protocol 
and enable communication and asset transfers between parachains in both ecosystems.
Overall, the development of this bridge is a significant step towards achieving the goals of both Kusama and Polkadot.
