# Liquidity Pools on launch

On launch, Pablo will support dual asset constant product pools based on the BalancerFi weighted math implementation of 
(x * y = K) for:

- KSM/USDT
- PICA/USDT
- PICA/KSM

Initially, Pablo pools will be the only way of swapping for PICA and will be governed by Picasso governance. 
Liquidity providers (LPs) on Pablo earn a percentage of all transaction fees which are proposed per pool but initially, 
they are 0.3%. Rewards are distributed based on share in the total pool leading to a pro-rata distribution.

Providing considerable amounts of liquidity to pools increases the portion of fees an LP is eligible for 
while Locking funds for longer periods increases voting power in governance. 
Pablo gives a doubled incentive for LPs to lock more funds for longer periods of time to support deep cross-chain liquidity
and facilitate price stability. This uniquely positions Pablo as the hub for cross-chain transactions in DeFi.
Providing liquidity and price stability rewards active members of the ecosystem 
for making decisions and having a true impact on Pablo and, by extension, Composable, and the wider DotSama ecosystem.

The initial pools on Pablo are a mere first step for deep cross-chain liquidity on DotSama. 
In time we will implement stableswap pools and our custom LBP implementation.
