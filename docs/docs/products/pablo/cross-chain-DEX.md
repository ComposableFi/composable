# Cross-chain DEX

**Pablo is a cross-chain DEX that sits on the natively interoperable Picasso ecosystem.**

Composable uses a dual para-chain approach. It has a Polkadot parachain, the Composable Parachain and a Kusama 
parachain, which houses Picasso. Picasso acts as the cross-chain hub for deployment and rapid innovation due to its 
interoperable technology stack that integrates with most major blockchain ecosystems.

Picasso uses the DotSama XCM channels and the Centauri IBC-Substrate bridge. 
XCM channels allow Picasso to connect to any parachain in the DotSama ecosystem where Pablo can be leveraged by other projects who 
wish to launch a token on a DEX through various auction methods, provide liquidity incentives, and bonding opportunities to increase POL.

The Centauri bridge allows Picasso to connect to the IBC-enabled blockchains. Initially bridging to the Cosmos 
ecosystem, Pablo functions in this position as a cross-chain DEX, that through different mechanisms is able to guarantee
liquidity even for newer token pairs, and serve as the next generation DEX in DeFi to function across the Substrate
and IBC ecosystems.
