# Apollo Deployment

Apollo can be used in smart contracts or in any other form of DeFi module which requires information on external assets.
Composable sits at an interoperable intersection of multiple ecosystems and Apollo’s functionality is central to any 
DeFi activity within most DeFi applications in the Composable ecosystem. 

Apollo serves as a base for decentralized products and services to leverage for price information and event 
verification. Developers can take advantage of Apollo in order to find reliable prices that avoid manipulation, and 
fraud. The XCVM is constructed to tap into other pallets within the Composable ecosystem which enables developers 
building applications on the XCVM to leverage Apollo for their protocols.

If you’re a developer and want to connect your protocol to Apollo, reach out to us on our 
[discord](https://discord.com/invite/composable).
