# Synergy with Centauri & XCVM

__Connecting Satellite protocols & orchestrating smart contracts across satellites__


At Composable, our mission is to promote a trustless and cohesive experience for web3. 
To achieve this, we have chosen to build a CosmWasm VM (Virtual Machine) 
as it is the most portable and robust solution available in the market. 
This decision is in line with our adoption of the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) 
as the basis of our transport layer via Centauri.
