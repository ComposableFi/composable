# Contracts - Technical Details

**For transparency, we are continuing to publicize the parachain vault approach we took when bidding for our Kusama and 
Polkadot parachains, as well as the contracts used in this process. This strategy is no longer being implemented to 
support parachain procurement, as this milestone has already been achieved. Please note that the information in 
italicized text below is outdated for this reason:**

_Our options for vault strategies were as follows:_



1. _Harvest dai with ETH // Harvest dai with DAI_
2. _Harvest usdc with ETH // Harvest usdc with USDC_
3. _Harvest usdt with ETH // Harvest usdt with USDT_
