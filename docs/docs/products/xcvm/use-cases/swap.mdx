# Cross-Chain Swap

:::tip

Developers should be interested to read [the XCVM
specification.](https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable/blob/b3ead07321238ec6d6435efea2f123f3000e0568/code/xcvm/SPEC.md)

:::

Many different applications can be built upon XCVM. **One of which** is a
cross-chain swap program.

Traditionally, users and applications were trading tokens that were only
available on their native chain. If you were operating on a chain **X**, you
would only be able to **swap** tokens that were registered on **X** (be it
native, ERC20 virtualized or even virtualized and wrapped like WETH).

Manipulating tokens is very complex already. Users willing to move assets
between chains are facing incredible difficulties. Not only bridging is hard,
but also insecure. In most cases, the bridges are centralized and hackable by
design. We, at Composable, try to push the blockchain vision forward, trustless
from the start to the end.

:::note Single-Chain Swap

Decentralized exchanges are one of (if not the one) the most widely used DeFi
protocols in the blockchain ecosystem. It allows (through a contract) anyone to
atomically exchange a token **A** against a token **B** at a defined rate (such
as with the invariant `x * y = k`). This operation is executed atomically from
within a transaction and we call this action a **swap**.

:::

In this example, we will execute a cross-chain swap through XCVM and understand
how programs are relayed, instructions executed and funds transferred. Be aware
that this use case can be generalized to any DeFi protocol and it is the reason
why **XCVM makes protocols cross-chain native**.

Under XCVM, tokens are **free to fly** between any chain connected to its
network. Not only they can be traded regardless of their origin, but they are
completely abstracted thanks to a globally unique XCVM **asset identifier**.

Let's take an example. Suppose we have [**Picasso**](https://picasso.xyz) and
[**Osmosis**](https://osmosis.zone) connected with an
[**IBC**](https://ibcprotocol.org/) bridge powered by
[**Centauri**](../../centauri-overview). **Alice** could submit the following
**XCVM program**, along **250 PICA** to execute a cross-chain swap:

```haskell
[
  -- 1. Move to Osmosis with a bag of 250 PICA.
  Spawn Osmosis Deterministic 0x0 [
    -- 1.1. (OPTIONAL) Tip the relayer for the journey.
    Transfer Relayer (PICA (Unit 25)),
    -- 1.2. Execute a swap, effectively trading 200 PICA for OSMO with 1% slippage tolerance.
    -- This might be replaced by an arbitrary `Call 0x042502` representing the swap,
    -- but for some well-known protocols, we decided to include a custom, strongly typed instruction.
    Swap (PICA (Unit 200)) OSMO 1%,
    -- 1.3. At this point, we don't know how many OSMOS/PICA we have.
    -- But we can ask XCVM to move 100% of both!
    Spawn Picasso Deterministic 0x01 [
      -- 1.3.1. (OPTIONAL) Tip the relayer for the cosy home with the remaining PICA.
      Transfer Relayer (PICA 100%),
      -- 1.3.2. Funds are safu.
      Transfer (OSMO 100% Alice)
    ] { OSMO: 100%, PICA: 100% }
  ] { PICA: Unit 250 }
]
```

1. Alice submits the XCVM program and the instruction **1.** is executed,
   resulting in:
   1. the **child XCVM program**, consisting of the instructions **[1.1., 1.2.,
     1.3.]** is being submitted within an IBC packet to **Osmosis**.
   2. the funds attached to the child program, **250 PICA**, are being
transferred to **Osmosis** using an [**ICS20
transfer**](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/f6371ffd5de3787eb4b85f9fe77f81be4a5993a0/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer/README.md).
2. An IBC relayer, listening to on-chain events, determine that relaying the IBC
  packet containing the XCVM program is profitable. It proceeds and relays both
  the funds and the packet to **Osmosis**.
3. The packet is being submitted by the relayer and subsequently processed on
   **Osmosis**, resulting in the **child XCVM program** being executed:
   1. the instruction **1.1.** is executed: **25 PICA** are transferred to the
      relayer.
   2. the instruction **1.2.** is executed: **200 PICA** are traded against an
      unknown amount **X** of **OSMO**.
   3. the instruction **1.3.** is executed, resulting in:
      1. the **second child XCVM program**, consisting of the instructions
      **[1.3.1., 1.3.2.]** is being submitted within an IBC packet to
      **Picasso**.
      2. the funds attached to the second child program, **100% of the OSMO and
         100% of the remaining PICA** are being transferred to **Picasso** using
         an **ICS20 transfer**.
4. Finally, an IBC relayer determines that relaying the program is again
   profitable, the packet and the funds are relayed to **Picasso**.
5. The packet is being submitted by the relayer and subsequently processed on
   **Picasso**, resulting in the **second child XCVM program** being executed:
   1. the instruction **1.3.1.** is executed: **100% of the remaining PICA**
      (25 + dust from the swap) is transferred to the relayer.
   2. the instruction **1.3.2.** is executed: **100% of the OSMO** is
      transferred back to **Alice**.

:::note

- The above program is a pseudocode. XCVM programs are represented as
**protobuf** encoded binary payload.
- Obviously, the sequence of instructions cannot be executed atomically, another
section is used to discuss how we circumvent issues related to atomicity.
- As per the XCVM specification, fees are covered by the relayer, another
section is used to discuss relayer incentives.
