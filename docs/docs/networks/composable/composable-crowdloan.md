# The Composable Crowdloan

Our crowdloan on Polkadot was critical in allowing us to successfully obtain the 8th Polkadot parachain slot during the 
7th round of auctions of these parachains. Over 9 thousand users participated in our crowdloan, depositing a total of 
6,075,485 DOT (a value of over $163 million at the time).

This crowdloan was available on our[ app](https://crowdloan.composable.finance/). Users were able to stake stablecoins 
or DOT, earn an APY on their stakes, and support the ever-growing Composable ecosystem. 


## Rewards

See a breakdown of our early bird incentives for the initial 12% allocated to crowdloan stakers:



* 5% bonus to those who staked in the first 24 hours
* 5% bonus to those who previously contributed KSM and stablecoins to the Picasso crowdloan stakers.
* 10% bonus to stakers in the first three days of opening the crowdloan
* 20% bonus for those who refer a total of 1000 DOT using our referral codes

Additionally,
[we announced an increase](https://composablefi.medium.com/christmas-comes-early-for-crowdloan-contributors-30-increase-in-rewards-ffc11c911af7) 
in the rewards for Composable crowdloan stakers. These added rewards come on top of the above early bird incentives. 
We ended up unlocking additional rewards and allocating 16% of LAYR's token supply for the crowdloan.
