# LAYR Tokenomics 

## LAYR use cases 

### Gas fees 

Transaction fees (or gas) are payable in LAYR. 


### Governance

LAYR will be used in voting to decide on key governance decisions, including: 



* Pallet onboarding: which pallets can be incorporated on the Composable  Parachain
* Ecosystem growth: directing Treasury towards different initiatives in the ecosystem such as grants and incentivizing 
  usage of the initial decentralized apps (dApps) on the network.
* Public goods infrastructure: powering infrastructure providers, block explorers, wallets, and other key ecosystem 
  partners.


### Collator staking 

Collators for the Composable Parachain are required to put down a stake to earn transaction fees.


### Oracle staking

Oracle operators are required to put down stakes to provide price feeds. They will be rewarded/ slashed according to the 
accuracy of the data they provide.


### Liquidity provisioning

Users can provide liquidity for yield through LAYR LP pairs on the Pablo DEX. 


## Total supply and genesis token distribution

The total supply of 100 million LAYR tokens are intended to be distributed and released according to the following:

**Team**: 25% (25,000,000 LAYR) of the total token supply will be distributed to founders and the core Composable team as a reward as well as incentives for their continued actions in the best interest in the Composable ecosystem. The distribution of these tokens will have a six-month cliff with linear vesting of the remaining tokens over the subsequent two and a half years.

**Token purchasers**: 23.71% of the total token supply (23,710,772 LAYR) will be distributed to early supporters and strategic backers. 13.36% (13,359,572 LAYR) of this allocation will have a 20% unlock at TGE, with the rest vesting over 24 months. 10.36% (10,351,000 LAYR) of this allocation will be locked for 6-month vesting period followed by linear vesting over 24 months.

**Emissions**: 10% (10,000,000 LAYR) of the total token supply will be released from the protocol as rewards and incentives for a number of actions involved in the protocol. These are programmatic incentives to bootstrap network growth (block validators, decentralized application builders and token holders from other networks) on Composable as well as token liquidity (liquidity mining programs). The full amount will be allocated upon TGE. *

**Crowdloans**: 16% (16,000,000 LAYR) of the total token supply will be allocated for the purposes of securing a parachain slot every two years. 16% is being utilized for the current batches of Polkadot auctions, with a 25% vesting on TGE, and the remainder vesting over two years.

**Treasury**: ~20.2% (20209228.31 LAYR) of the total token supply will be allocated to the Composable Treasury. The full amount will be allocated upon TGE. *

**Polkadot vault strategy**: 5.08% (5,080,000 LAYR) of the total token supply will be rewarded to participants in our Polkadot vault strategy. ~8.3% of this (423,333.33 LAYR) will be released at TGE, with the remaining distributed over one year.
