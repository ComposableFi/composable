# Composable Parachain's Governance

Composable’s Polkadot parachain will ultimately become completely decentralized and democratic after the TGE of LAYR, its native token. This requires a sufficient user base, so in the initial stages of parachain deployment, the Composable parachain will operate under an OpenGov structure lead by the Composable Council and Technical Committee. 

## Composable OpenGov

Similar to phase 1 of OpenGov on Picasso, members of the Council and Tech Committee on Composable will hold a GOV token to interact with Composable governance.

The following tables outline the governance procedures and parameters related to the Governance tracks.

| Support Threshold | Whitelist Track Time (Passing) | Root Track Time (Passing) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 10%               | 12 hours 0 minutes       | 5 days 14 hours      |
| 20%               | 3 hours 20 minutes       | 4 days 4 hours       |
| 30%               | 1 hour 15 minutes        | 2 days 18 hours      |

With X % of support, Referenda can pass after Y duration (time periods in the table) since the beginning of referenda depending on whethere the approval rate is above the approval curve.

| Track Type            | Confirm Period    | Decision Period (Voting) |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Whitelist Track       | 30 minutes        | 4 days                   |
| Sudo Track            | 1 day             | 7 days                   |


Any member from the two collectives is allowed to submit a referenda.To cancel a specific referendum, you need a 1/3 approval from the Technical Committee. To Kill a referendum, 1/2 approval from the Council is necessary, particularly when the referendum is deemed malicious.

Regarding the whitelisted track, if you want to include the hash of a proposal, you must obtain either 1/3 approval from the Technical Committee or 1/3 approval from the Council. This is the operational procedure for the whitelisted track. If a proposal passes but its hash isn't added to the whitelist, the proposal will fail to execute.
## Governance Collectives
### Composable Council

Composable’s Polkadot parachain governance is carried out via OpenGov processes lead by the Council and Technical Committee. Once core pallets are onboarded onto the parachain and the LAYR token has gone through the TGE, the netowrk will be governed by the community. 

The on-chain Composable Council comprises 11 members including senior Composable team members and Composable supporters. Council members are also responsible for controlling the Composable parachain’s multi-sig wallets.

Composable Council members are as follows:

- Henry Love, Executive Director of Composable Foundation

The role of the Technical Committee includes approval of the Whitelist track for upgrades, integrations, ensuring the technical stability and critical safety measures of the parachain.
