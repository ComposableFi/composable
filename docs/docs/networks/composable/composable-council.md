# Composable Parachain's Governance

Composable’s Polkadot parachain will ultimately become completely decentralized and democratic after the TGE of LAYR, its native token. This requires a sufficient user base, so in the initial stages of parachain deployment, the Composable parachain will operate under an OpenGov structure lead by the Composable Council and Technical Committee. 

## Composable OpenGov

Similar to phase 1 of OpenGov on Picasso, members of the Council and Tech Committee on Composable will hold a GOV token to interact with Composable governance.

The following tables outline the governance procedures and parameters related to the Governance tracks.

| Support Threshold | Whitelist Track Time (Passing) | Root Track Time (Passing) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 10%               | 12 hours 0 minutes       | 5 days 14 hours      |
| 20%               | 3 hours 20 minutes       | 4 days 4 hours       |
| 30%               | 1 hour 15 minutes        | 2 days 18 hours      |

With X % of support, Referenda can pass after Y duration (time periods in the table) since the beginning of referenda depending on whethere the approval rate is above the approval curve.

| Track Type            | Confirm Period    | Decision Period (Voting) |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Whitelist Track       | 30 minutes        | 4 days                   |
| Sudo Track            | 1 day             | 7 days                   |


Any member from the two collectives is allowed to submit a referenda. The Cancel referenda requires 1/3 approval from the Technical Committee and the Kill referenda requires 1/2 of the Council approval to execute. The Whitelist Track requires either a 1/3 approval from the Tech Committee or 1/3 council. The Whitelist Track requires either a 1/3 approval from the Tech Committee or 1/3 council.
