# Composable Parachain's Governance

Composable’s Polkadot parachain will ultimately become completely decentralized and democratic upon the TGE of LAYR, its native token. This requires a sufficient user base, so in the initial stages of parachain deployment, the Composable parachain will operate under an OpenGov structure lead by the Composable Council and Technical Committee.  

## Governance Collectives

### Composable Council

Composable’s Polkadot parachain governance is carried out via OpenGov processes lead by the Council and Technical Commitee. Once core pallets are onboarded onto the parachain and the LAYR token has gone through the TGE, the netowrk will be governed by the community. 

The on-chain Composable Council comprises 11 members including senior Composable team members and Composable supporters. Council members are also responsible for controlling the Composable parachain’s multi-sig wallets.

Composable Council members are as follows:
- 0xBrainJar, Composable Founder/CRO
- Henry Love, Fundamental Labs Managing Partner
- Blas Rodriguez Irizar, Composable Co-Founder & CTO
- Don DeTommasso, Composable Head of Governance & Strategy
- Miguel Santefé, Composable Co-Founder & Head of Design
- Joon W., Composable FE Lead
- Jafar Azam, Composable Devrel
- Jesse Abramowitz, Entropy Lead Software and Protocol Engineer
- Will Pankiewicz, Parity Master of Validators
- Tamara Frankel, D1 Ventures Founding Partner
- James Wo, Digital Finance Group (DFG) Founder & Chairman

The Composable Council will act to protect and support the functionality of the Composable parachain. 

### Technical Committee

The Technical Committee for the Composable parachain consists of 5 core developers who are chosen by the Council. The members of the Technical Committee is initially composed of Composable Finance developers. The role of the Technical Committee includes, among others, ensuring the technical stability and critical safety measures of the parachain.
