## Picasso Crowdloan Details

Composable has won the 13th Kusama parachain auction slot, 
raising 115,017 KSM and successfully securing a parachain to build out and deploy the Picasso network. 
Crowdloan participation was capped at 200,000 KSM and the crowdloan period will total 48 weeks, 
broken down into 8 lease periods of 6 weeks each.
 
Initially, 20% of Picassoâ€™s native token supply was allocated to the crowdloan: 2,000,000,000 PICA. 
However, as a result of the bonuses awarded to crowdloan participants,
the total allocated supply of PICA amounted to 30% (3,000,000,000 PICA).

### Referral Bonus

We implemented a referral program where users were able to generate referral codes 
and obtain a 20% bonus on their PICA tokens if they brought in other users contributing a total of 100 KSM or more.

### Early Participation Bonuses

Users who participated early on in the Picasso crowdloan received a boost on their earnings: 
participating in the first 12 hours provided such users with a 5% bonus, 
and participating in the first three days provided a 10% bonus.

### Bonus to Prior Stakers

Within the 30% PICA rewards for crowdloan participants, 
5% is allocated as a bonus to contributors who previously staked in our crowdloan,
and restake the same amount or greater. The bonus will be subject to the amount contributed to the prior round.
