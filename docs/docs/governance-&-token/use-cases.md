# PICA Use Cases

PICA is the native token of Picasso, powering the cross-ecosystem IBC and Restaking Hub. It is positioned to be the network and native token for cross-ecosystem-IBC transfer activity. The vision is serve as the infrastructure network for cross-chain interaction and execution on MANTIS to abstract the UX of having to individually navigate between dApps and chains in a secure manner.

A concerted effort has been made to ensure that the PICA token holds as much utility as possible by incorporating various value accrual methods and governance features.

## What is $PICA used for?


## Governance

In pursuit of a trustless and interoperable vision, PICA plays a crucial role, as [governance on Picasso](../picasso/governance.md) is operating OpenGov phase 2.

Additionally, as PICA serves as the native token of Composable Cosmos, it is essential for governance on the [Composable Cosmos](../composable-cosmos.md) chain as well.
## Validator staking
PICA is used to secure Picasso. This is the first instance of a token being utilized for validation within both the Kusama and Cosmos ecosystems and highlights the critical role PICA plays within cross-ecosystem communication.  

### Bridging Fees Distribution 
A percentage of the bridging fees generated by each new IBC connection involving Picasso will be allocated to [stakers of PICA on Composable Cosmos](/docs/docs/user-guides/pica-staking.md). At present, stakers receive rewards from the Polkadot-Cosmos IBC connection. 

With the introduction of Solana and Ethereum IBC connections in Q1 of 2024, 20% of the bridging fees from these connections will be distributed to PICA stakers. 

### AVS Payment Distribution
The Generalized Restaking Layer will secure the launches and activity of various Actively Validated Services (AVS) enhancing revenue generation for PICA stakers. A portion of the revenue, specifically 20%, will be directed towards PICA stakers. The initial AVS to be launched will be the Guest blockchain on Solana, which facilitates the Solana IBC connection.

## Staking Reward Curve for Bridging Fees

Users may stake their PICA for a % share of revenue generated from bridging fees. The PICA staking rewards curve acts as a method of rewarding users who have staked their PICA over a threshold duration of time. Users who hit a maximum duration of 90-days staked will receive a proportional share of the 20% of bridge revenue allocated towards PICA stakers. 

| Days | % of Fee-Split | Redistributed % |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
|  1    |   1.11%       |    -------      |
|  7     |  7.78%        |   -------       |
|  14     |   15.56%       | -------         |
|  30     |   33.33%       |  15%        |
|  60     |   66.67%       |  35%        |
| 90  | 100%       | 50% |

Per the table above, a user accrues a greater % of their revenue share linearly over the course of their staking period until reaching the maximum of 90-days, at which point, they will begin to accrue their full share of the 20% revenue split. Users who have not reached the full 90-day threshold, will have their remaining share redistributed upward across the curve. 

**Example**

As a simple example - take two users that have staked their PICA. User A has staked for 90-days and user B has staked for 1-Day. 

User A Rev Share = 100% * (PICA_Staked / Total_PICA_Staked) * (20% Bridging Revenue), whereas,

User B Rev Share = 1.11% * (PICA_Staked / Total_PICA_Staked) * (20% Bridging Revenue)

Further, 98.89% of User Bâ€™s Rev Share would be allocated to users further up the curve (in this case, there is only User A)
Share of redistributed revenue up the curve for longer-duration stakers will only be split amongst the 30/60/90 day threshold as follows:

Share of redistributed revenue up the curve for longer-duration stakers will only be split amongst the 30/60/90 day threshold as follows:

- 30 Days <= x < 60 Days : receive 15% of redistributed revenue from stakers lower in the curve
- 60 Days <= x < 90 Days : receive 35% of redistributed revenue from stakers lower in the curve
- 90 Days <= x : receive 50% of redistributed revenue from stakers lower in the curve -->
