Following the approval of Referendum 63 on Picasso, ~9% of unclaimed crowdloan rewards were transferred to the Treasury. Following council motion 23, 1 billion PICA from this allocation is currently bonded on Picasso to secure the network. **                                                                                                              |

The crowdloan stakers earned 50% of their PICA upon TGE, with the remainder released linearly within 48 weeks. The full balance can be used to participate in governance and other activities besides transferring. Any unclaimed rewards from the crowdloan will be transferred to the Picasso treasury three months after the crowdloan vesting period is concluded via a treasury proposal. This was executed after community referendum 63 on OpenGov. |
