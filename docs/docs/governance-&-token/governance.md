# Governance
Similar to the way that majority of Cosmos SDK chains operate, validators can vote using tokens they are delegated with. However, if a delegator votes themselves, their voting decision will override the validatorâ€™s vote if the decision differs. The parameters for the governance on Picasso are as follows:

| Parameter                                          | Period/Number  |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Total Deposit                           | 2 million PICA          |
| Quorum          | 30%         |
| Voting Period | 1 day        |
| Threshold                | 50% |
| No-with-veto                             |  33%   |
