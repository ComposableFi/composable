::: note
By clicking the ‘settings’ ⚙️’ icon, users can adjust their slippage tolerance and set a transaction deadline

Slippage: The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. 
When an order is executed but there isn't enough volume at the chosen price to maintain the current bid/ask spread.

Transaction Deadline: The amount of time the transaction stays “alive” to be processed on chain. 
High network load can cause extended processing time, 
possibly leading to changes in market details for ongoing transaction.
