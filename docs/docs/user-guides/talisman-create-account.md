# How to create a Talisman account for Picasso
The [Talisman wallet](https://talisman.xyz/) is an easy way of interacting with the DotSama ecosystem by providing 
a parachain interoperable wallet while also connecting Substrate with EVM (Ethereum-Virtual-Machine). 
Aside from the foregoing use of the Talisman wallet, it also guides users by turning complexity into transparency 
through comprehensive transactions.
It functions similarly to Metamask: take part in Polkadot and Kusama, have all your DotSama tokens in one place, 
and still be able to connect to Ethereum whenever you need to with Talisman.

This guide will show the user how to set up a Talisman account using the browser extension, 
followed by how to connect the account we create to Picasso. 
It is highly recommended to read and understand the complete instructions before following along.

![create_new_wallet](./images-talisman-create-account/create-new-wallet.png)

1. Click on "New wallet"

As an option, Talisman allows you to import a wallet from Metamask. However, for purposes of this guide, 
we will create a new one from the very beginning and will not be importing a wallet from Metamask.

## Account Details & Privacy
On the following pages, you will be asked to set a password and to authorize the collection 
of anonymous usage information and the sending of anonymized error reports.

1. Set a password
2. Click “Continue”
3. Choose if you want to send anonymized usage and error information to Talisman
4. Click either “No Thanks” or “I agree”

Secure your Passphrase:
We have arrived at the dashboard/portfolio. In the future, you will see your assets for each parachain on this page. 
Since it is your first time here, Talisman will ask you to backup your twelve-word mnemonic seed (passphrase)
which is used to restore your wallet and we recommend you to keep it safe using 
a password manager of your choice in order to prevent losing your assets.
Please DO NOT share your passphrase with anyone. 
Your seed grants full access to ALL funds stored in that account and all accounts derived from it.

## Connect to Picasso

To use the complete feature set of Picasso, a wallet needs to be connected. 
You can use the Talisman account we just created or a Polkadot.js account. 
Check our guide on [how to make a Polkadot.js account](./polkadotjs-extension-create-account.md) for Picasso.

1. Click “Wallets” in the top right corner
2. Click “Polkadot”
3. Select a wallet of your choice. In this case, we use the Talisman account we created earlier

On the following page, you will see all the wallets associated with the connected account. If you create/derive more wallets in the future, they will show up here.

You can now use Picasso with the accounts and their respective wallets we just connected.
