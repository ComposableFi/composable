:::warning
Protect your seed phrase like your life depends on it, as anyone with access to it can potentially gain control of your blockchain accounts and assets. Never share your seed phrase online or with anyone you don't absolutely trust.
:::


Next, add a display name for the account (e.g., Picasso) and set a password. 

## Add Composable Cosmos to Keplr
After verifying your recovery phrase, you will come across a drop down menu to add support for the chains of your choice. 

In the search bar type “Composable”, choose the Composable chain and click “Save".

:::tip 
If you don't see the Composable Cosmos chain in the dropdown, head to Keplr settings. In the general section, look for the option to manage non-native chains. Here, you can add the Composable chain.

## Add Composable Cosmos Testnet to Keplr

If you're interacting with the Composable Cosmos Testnet which was previously referred to as Centauri and Bansky, simply add `centauri-testnet` similar to the previous step.
