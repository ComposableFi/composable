:::warning
Protect your seed phrase like your life depends on it, as anyone with access to it can potentially gain control of your blockchain accounts and assets. Never share your seed phrase online or with anyone you don't absolutely trust.

Next, add a display name for the account (e.g., Picasso) and set a password. 

## Add Picasso to Keplr
After verifying your recovery phrase, you will come across a drop down menu to add support for the chains of your choice. 

In the search bar type “Picasso” and click “Save".

:::tip 
If you don't see Picasso in the dropdown:
1. Head to Keplr "General" in settings
2. Select the "Add/Remove Non-Native Chains" option
3. Add Picasso
