Note: By clicking the ‘settings’ ⚙️’ icon, users can adjust their slippage tolerance and set a transaction deadline.

Slippage: The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. 
When a large order is executed but there isn't enough volume at the chosen price to maintain the current bid/ask spread.

Transaction Deadline: The amount of time the transaction stays “alive” to be processed on chain. 
High network load can cause extended processing time leading to changes in market details for ongoing transaction.
