# How to LP on the Pablo DEX

![how_to_LP_title](./images-provide-liquidity/how-to-lp-title.png)

Providing liquidity on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Pablo can be a way to earn passive income 
by providing assets to liquidity pools. Here is a guide on how to provide liquidity on the Pablo DEX. 
Release 2 will begin with 3 pools on launch which are as follows:

- KSM/USDT
- PICA/USDT
- PICA/KSM

The Picasso Council has proposed to set the fees for these inaugural pools at 0.3%. 
Users can provide liquidity to earn a portion of the fees accrued by these pools. 
The total fee charged on a swap, buy, or sell is calculated as a percentage of the swap size 
and distributed to liquidity providers in proportion to their share of the pool.
