# How to stake your LP tokens on Pablo

Providing liquidity on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Pablo can be a way to earn passive income by providing assets to liquidity pools.
Here is a guide on how to provide liquidity on the Pablo DEX. 

The Picasso Council has proposed a fee of 0.3% for the inaugural pools. Users who provide liquidity to these pools can earn a share of the fees that the pools generate. The fees for swapping, buying or selling tokens are calculated as a percentage of the swap size and are distributed among liquidity providers based on their share of the pool.

To learn how to swap tokens on Pablo, you can follow a step-by-step tutorial provided in this guide.
