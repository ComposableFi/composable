# Staking PICA on Composable Cosmos

This guide demonstrates the steps to transfer PICA to [Composable Cosmos](../networks/composable-cosmos.md) and stake PICA by delegating them to validators on the network. 

## Download the Leap extension​
The following link allows you to download the Leap extension: https://www.leapwallet.io/download

Once downloaded and installed, click on 'Leap Cosmos Wallet' in your extensions where you will be redirected to setup your wallet.

## Setting up an account​

To setup an account on your Leap extension, you have the following three options:

1. “Create new wallet” and then "Create new recovery phrase". Ensure you have secured your passphrase. 
2. Import an existing seed phrase or wallet. 
3. Connect a hardware wallet (If your PICA is on a ledger device)

To begin, you need to send PICA to Composable Cosmos. Go to https://app.trustless.zone/ and connect both your Polkadot and Leap wallet.

Head to the [staking page on Leapboard](https://cosmos.leapwallet.io/transact/stake/plain) and select the Picasso chain. Enter the amount of PICA you wish to stake, choose a validator to delegate your tokens to and press Stake.

## Alternative Method
Head to https://ping.pub/composable and connect your wallet. Select the 'Delegate' button and the validator you wish to delegate your PICA tokens to. Enter the amount of PICA you wish to stake.

:::tip
Ensure the 'Fees' are set to 0 after clicking the Advance option as outlined in the screenshot.

You have now successfully staked PICA to secure Composable Cosmos!

:::note
The Composable Cosmos network requires PICA to be delegated to a validator to earn staking rewards. To unstake PICA after delegation, it must undergo a 21-day "unbonding" period to receive your tokens.
