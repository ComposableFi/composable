# Staking PICA on Composable Cosmos

This guide demonstrates the steps to transfer PICA to [Composable Cosmos](../parachains/composable-cosmos.md) and stake PICA by delegating them to validators on the network. 

1. To begin, you need to send PICA from Picasso to Composable Cosmos. Go to https://app.trustless.zone/ and connect both your Polkadot and Cosmos wallets.

Ensure the 'Fees' are set to 0 after clicking the Advance option as outlined in the screenshot.

You have now successfully staked PICA to secure Composable Cosmos!

:::note
The Composable Cosmos network requires PICA to be delegated to a validator to earn staking rewards. To unstake PICA after delegation, it must undergo a 21-day "unbonding" period to receive your tokens.
