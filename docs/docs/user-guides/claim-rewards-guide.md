# How to claim your crowdloan rewards

Steps to claim your crowdloan rewards:

1. Go to www.picasso.xyz connect your wallet and hit ‘claim’
2. PICA tokens will go to your wallet but they **can’t be moved/transferred until TGE**
3. On TGE you will not have to do anything, your tokens will be transferable
4. The other 50% of tokens are subject to a vesting schedule found on docs.composable.finance.
5. Based on the vesting pallet logic, the unvested tokens will be viewable in users’ wallets on the day of TGE.
6. From that point, users can periodically visit the website and hit claim with the same wallet connected to claim the 
   remaining crowdloan rewards, which converts unvested tokens into liquid tokens.
