# How to Restake your tokens 

The [MANTIS app](https://games.mantis.app/) enables you to restake your assets effortlessly using intents. You will need a Phantom wallet to interact with the application. Just prompt the token and amount you want to stake or follow the suggestions. 

After connecting your wallet, you will see the following screen. Currently, you can either restake bSOL, mSOL, jitoSOL or SOL (staking SOL occurs via converting SOL into wSOL and then transferring it to the vault).
