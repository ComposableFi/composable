## Setting up an account​

To setup an account on your Leap extension, you have the following three options:

1. “Create new wallet” and then "Create new recovery phrase". Ensure you have secured your passphrase. 
2. Import an existing seed phrase or wallet.
3. Connect a hardware wallet

:::warning
Protect your seed phrase like your life depends on it, as anyone with access to it can potentially gain control of your blockchain accounts and assets. Never share your seed phrase online or with anyone you don't absolutely trust.

Next, add a display name for the account (e.g., Pablo Picasso) and set a password.
