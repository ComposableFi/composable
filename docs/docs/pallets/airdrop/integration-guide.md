## Setup / Configuration

Airdrops are created and managed by users. Only the airdrop creator will have 
access to life cycle methods of the airdrop. Airdrops have three states: 
created, enabled, disabled. These states transition linearly. 

During the created state, no claims can be made, but all management transactions 
can be conducted. During the enabled state, claims can be made and management 
transactions can be conducted in a limited fashion. During the disabled state, 
the airdrop and its relevant info in pallet storage will be deleted.

Automatic state transitions can accrue under two conditions. 1) The Airdrop was 
provided with a scheduled `start_at` and that time has come, the Airdrop will be 
enabled. 2) All funds in the Airdrop have been claimed and/or a recipient was 
deleted that leaves no more funds to claim, the Airdrop will be disabled and 
deleted from storage.

For more details on the Airdrop life cycle, see the [Workflow section](../airdrop.md#workflow) 
of the Pallet Overview & Workflow file. This information is retrieved directly 
from the pallet's `README.md`.
