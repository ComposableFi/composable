## Calculations & Sources of Values

*"Provide calculations of APY or APR if any and mention the source of all values
that need to be fetched from the chain/backend/subsquid or any other data
source"*

## Extrinsic Parameter Sources

*Document sources of extrinsic parameters, hard coded, calculated on the front
end, user provided*
