# Vault Pallet Extrinsics

## Create

[`create`](https://dali.devnets.composablefinance.ninja/doc/pallet_vault/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.create)

Creates a new vault, locking up the deposit. If the deposit is greater than the
`ExistentialDeposit` + `CreationDeposit`, the vault will remain alive forever, else it
can be `tombstoned` after `deposit / RentPerBlock `. Accounts may deposit more funds to
keep the vault alive.

### Emits

* [`Event::VaultCreated`](Event::VaultCreated)

### Errors

* When the origin is not signed.
* When `deposit < CreationDeposit`.
* Origin has insufficient funds to lock the deposit.

## Claim Surcharge

[`claim_surcharge`](https://dali.devnets.composablefinance.ninja/doc/pallet_vault/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.claim_surcharge)

Subtracts rent from a vault, rewarding the caller if successful with a small fee and
possibly tombstoning the vault.

A tombstoned vault still allows for withdrawals but blocks deposits, and requests all
strategies to return their funds.
