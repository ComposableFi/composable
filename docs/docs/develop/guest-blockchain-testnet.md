# Guest Blockchain Testnet Guide

:::info
This document serves as a guide for becoming a validator of the Guest Blockchain on Solana during the testing phase. Only current Solana validators have the capability to validate the Guest Blockchain. Additional information can be found [here](../technology/solana-restaking/technical-overview.md).
:::

### Validator Security Model
The validator set of the Guest Blockchain will be directed by majority where it is the responsibility of active validators to maintain uptime and sign corresponding payloads of transactions.

### Bonding

Joining as a validator will require a bonded stake to keep participation gated from malicious actors easily onboarding. The size of the bond will be 0.1 SOL.

###Â (Re) Staking
The validator set will be able to utilize liquid staked derivatives of SOL, such as jitoSOL, mSOL, bSOL and LST.   

### Oracles
Pyth oracle will be used to access pricing feeds for LSD assets staked to the platform.
