and `Dispatch` execution types and their use cases.
* [Address handlers](./address-handlers.md): Explains why we have different APIs and how you can
implement your address handler based on your needs.
* [Custom message/query handler](./custom-handler.md): Explains how a user can enable handling of `CosmosMsg::Custom` and `QueryRequest::Custom`.
