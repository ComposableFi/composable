# Audit Results and Remediations

Composable Finance coding is regularly audited by renowned security auditing firms.

**Code fixes, audit reports and subsequent fixes are available [here](https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable/tree/main/audits) on our GitHub.**


# Immunefi Bug Bounty Program

As a part of Composable’s ongoing commitment to security, 
we are proud to announce the renewal of our bug bounty program in collaboration with Immunefi. 
Immunefi is the blockchain industry’s leading bug bounty program, having secured more than $60 billion in user funds. 
There have been some adjustments to the scope and rewards of this program which will be outlined in this article.

## Program details
Immunefi classifies bugs based on a [5-level scale] ranging from: none, low, medium, high, and critical. 
In addition, Immunefi has separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchain/DLT. 
As a team building infrastructure across 2 parachains in the form of pallets, 
which are incorporated directly into the runtime of our blockchains, 
we are primarily concerned with blockchain/DLT related bugs. 
Critical vulnerabilities in other areas will be considered by the Composable team, 
but are not within the scope of this bounty program.

### Assets in Scope
The [Picasso parachain] is the primary focus of this bounty program. You can find a link to our GitHub [here], 
but keep in mind that blockchain/DLT related bugs will be prioritized for the purpose of this program. 
Rewards will be provided for medium, high, and critical vulnerabilities. 
A breakdown of this reward structure can be found below:

#### Blockchain/DLT bounties
Critical ($30,000 - up to $500,000)
- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (Total network shutdown)
- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (Network partition requiring hard fork)
- Direct loss of funds
- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)
- RPC API crash that causes severe or total disruption
- Ability to halt the chain or alter block productions / the network by providing bad input data

High ($5,000 - up to $30,000)
- Unintended chain split (Network partition)
- Transient consensus failures
- 
Medium ($500 - up to $5,000)
- High compute consumption by validator/mining nodes
- Attacks against thin clients

All Critical and High Blockchain/DLT bug reports must come with a PoC 
with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. 
Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.

Reward maximums vary case-by-case with direct regard to the impact of the threat presented 
and scoped as determined by Composable Finance personnel. 
Composable Finance offers varying guaranteed minimum payouts for all levels of vulnerabilities with an accompanying PoC. 
Reward maximums will not exceed $500,000.

Composable Finance requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. 
The information needed are usually 2 forms of Photo Identification and Proof of Address. 
The collection of this information is done by the project team.

## Prohibited activities
As mentioned previously, 
any vulnerabilities regarding smart contracts or web applications are excluded from the scope of this program. 
In addition, the following activities are prohibited by this program:

- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets
- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage
- Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials
- Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)
- Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts
- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our personnel and/or customers
- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO 
  providers, advertising networks)
- Any denial of service attacks
- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic
- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty
