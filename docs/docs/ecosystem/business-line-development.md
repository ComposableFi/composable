# Integrations

External projects, infrastructure providers and community developers can build on Composable in a permissionless space to make their own applications interoperable and more intuitive, 

To get in touch with the Composable team if you have additional questions or require development support for any of the following operations, create a ticket or reach out via the public development support channels. Composable offers the following services for :

## Cosmos chains onboarding:

Onboarding IBC-enabled chains is a permissionless and seamless process. Teams would have to set up a relayer between their Cosmos chain and [Composable Cosmos](../networks/composable-cosmos.md) in order to connect to Picasso and Ethereum. 

## HRMP Cross-chain channel onboarding:

Onboarding other parachains to connect to Picasso, Composable and IBC-enabled chains requires HRMP channel openings which is a governance based process. 

### Apollo onboarding:

Onboarding individuals/entities that can provide data for our oracle pallet, [Apollo](../technology/apollo-overview.md), 
like Teller and API3. 

### Collator onboarding:

Onboarding individuals/entities that can provide data for our oracle pallet, [Apollo](../technology/apollo-overview.md), 
like Teller and API3. 
### Data provider onboarding:

Onboarding individuals/entities that can provide data for our oracle pallet, [Apollo](../technology/apollo-overview.md), 
like Teller and API3. 

### Pallet onboarding:

Onboarding pallets onto [Picasso](../parachains/picasso-parachain-overview.md) and [Composable Polkadot](../networks/composable-parachain-overview.md) is a governance based process. On Composable, this is decided by the Technical Committee and Council and on Picasso, this is decided by PICA holders. 

### Infrastructure onboarding:
Onboarding new layers, chains, and their associated validators into our ecosystem and interoperable infrastructure. 

### Building modular applications with the Composable CVM:
Onboarding developers to use the [Composable Cross-Chain VM (CVM)](../technology/cvm.md).
