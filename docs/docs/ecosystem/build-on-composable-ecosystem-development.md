# Build on Composable: Ecosystem Development

*To help usher in the interoperable future of DeFi, 
Composable Labs actively supports developers building projects with our technology. 
This includes projects using pallets on our Picasso parachain and those building with our cross-chain technology.*

## Composable Ecosystem

[The Composable Labs team](https://medium.com/@ComposableLabs/introducing-composable-labs-our-approach-to-building-and-developing-a-substrate-focused-605415f8ac79) 
operates as the research, development, and incubation division of Composable 
and comprises a team of 14 researchers, developers, and engineers. Composable Labs serves three core purposes: 
Firstly, exploring partnerships with existing projects in the DeFi space. 
Secondly, crafting protocol designs with aspiring founders who share their vision of a blockchain-agnostic future
and offering them incubation grants. Thirdly, building protocols in-house that harness the Composable tech stack. 

As Composable’s tech stack is primarily based on Substrate pallets, 
Composable Labs is heavily focused on Substrate-based DeFi. 
Composable Labs’ Substrate primitives are at the pioneering front of DeFi innovation and represent novel advancements. 
They are built as modular pallets that can be natively ‘stacked’ by any DeFi developer to create new services. 
The primitives Composable Labs are building to fill critical gaps within the DotSama ecosystem 
are vital to the realization of DotSama’s potential.

### [Angular Finance](https://angularfinance.medium.com/)

[Angular Finance](https://www.angular.finance/) is a cross-chain money market that will enable 
the permissionless creation of isolated pools for any asset part of Composable’s ecosystem. 
Angular will also offer leverage as a service, liquidation as a service, flash loans, 
and unique capabilities such as the option to provide NFTs and fNFTs as collateral, among other functionalities.

### Instrumental Finance:

[Instrumental Finance](https://www.instrumental.finance/) 
is a cross-chain-and-layer LP position movement and arbitrage protocol. 
LPs can deposit any asset belonging to Composable’s ecosystem into an Instrumental Vault. 
Instrumental will automatically deploy the funds to the highest yield-earning platform and pool currently available, 
regardless of the chain or layer it is on.

### Whirlpool Cash:

[Whirlpool Cash](https://www.whirlpoolcash.com/) is a native, 
privacy-preserving protocol that works by mixing transactions into a collective, anonymized pool. 
In addition, Whirlpool uses yield farms to generate returns for 
those who deposit assets that are part of Composable’s ecosystem, which are later paid back to contributors. 
This compensates for any costs incurred through transaction fees 
and inverts the traditional view of privacy in DeFi as a cost-driver.

## Composable Labs Roadmap

### Phase 1

Composable Labs will develop and run in-house and incubated projects. 
These include Substrate primitives such as Angular Finance, Ensemble, and Whirlpool Cash. 
During each phase, Composable Labs will continue researching innovative solutions for DeFi products and services.

### Phase 2

Composable Labs will dedicate members of its talent pool to project-specific needs and enable developers to use 
the resources available at Composable to build faster, more efficiently, and scale at will. 
Angular, for example, already has a dedicated team of Composable Labs engineers to aid in the project’s development.

### Phase 3

During this phase, Composable will be entirely up and running, and the pallets on Picasso. 
Composable Labs will heavily explore the nested parachain approach to project deployment on the Composable parachain. 
This means that each project will become a nested parachain.

## Composable Research

Composable Labs is always working towards advancing innovative ideas, 
identifying market trends, and discovering untapped potential. 
This is not only the case for in-house projects – Composable Labs works closely with incubated project teams to identify 
problems, shortcomings, and opportunities for new functionality or increased efficiency. 

Composable Labs have recently researched and developed Instrumental Finance’s pallet on Picasso. 
This benefits mainnet and EVM ecosystem users looking to farm yield on Picasso and DotSama. 
As Picasso-based pallets start offering liquidity rush events (LREs) and other strategies, 
Ethereum and other EVM communities can participate in these fresh APY opportunities without the hassle of installing a 
Polkadot.js wallet. 

Composable Labs works in tandem with our in-house lead cryptography researcher, 
[@Cryptoni0x](https://twitter.com/Cryptoni0x), who plays a crucial role in researching cryptographic primitives and the 
technology that surrounds it. Composable Labs are developing several primitives that will serve as fundamental DeFi 
products and services for users on Picasso.

As we work to confront MEV in the DeFi ecosystem and explore opportunities to leverage the idea for the good of 
Composable Finance, we will continue to research and discussions within our team and community. 
[You can check out this post](https://medium.com/@ComposableLabs/addressing-mev-in-composables-cross-layer-solution-b59f91fc46dc) 
by 0xbrainjar and CryptoNymph stating our team's approach to addressing MEV in the Composable ecosystem.

**Composable Labs will continue to grow its research presence and is always looking for individuals to add to their 
talent pool.**

## The Resources Provided To Developers:

The ingenuity of developers is at the core of DeFi’s growth towards a more end-user-friendly and optimized industry. 
As stated in the [announcement](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/picasso-f17705da670e) of our procurement of a parachain 
for Picasso, we see the potential for dApps built in our ecosystem only to be limited by a developer’s imagination. 
To untether this potential, it is essential to provide resources to improve the creative and developmental process.


Composable Labs is recruiting projects to build on Picasso. Individuals and teams can contribute to a cutting-edge 
ecosystem with the potential to win grants and developmental/marketing assistance. We invite community members and 
developers to build these pallets on Picasso, with the most promising projects being incubated by Composable Labs. 
Thus, developers can work with all of the tools they need to build powerful applications and receive the support to 
achieve success.


Beyond funding, developers working on Polkadot and Kusama will be given access to any of our existing pallets, 
such as our oracle and vault pallets, 
[Apollo](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/introducing-apollo-an-mev-resistant-oracle-884efae18848) and 
[Cubic](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/introducing-cubic-setting-the-standard-for-vault-infrastructure-in-polkadot-and-kusama-8c1ab9390c5f). 
Developers working on Ethereum will get access to 
[Mosaic](https://medium.com/composable-finance/introducing-mosaic-phase-2-10d1bfe5f6f8), 
facilitating the development of cross-layer dApp projects. Once an Ethereum project reaches a particular stage of 
development, Composable’s team can also help port it to 
[Rust pallets](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/pallets) 
and deploy them on our parachain. Once the 
[Cross-Chain Virtual Machine (XCVM)](https://dali.devnets.composablefinance.ninja/products/cross-chain-virtual-machine.html) 
launches, this technology will also be available for developers to capitalize upon.


Along with the above tools and funds, a key piece of Composable’s value add for developers is the team we have to 
support you. Grant participants will be able to leverage the Composable team to assist with furthering their product 
development roadmap.
Additionally, in some of the most promising cases, we can jump in and build alongside teams we selected for our grants 
program. 
We are currently doing this with projects working with Composable Labs and plan to expand this offering to the grants 
program on a case by case basis.

To further support and incentivize the development on Picasso, 
we have launched[ Grant Program](https://grants.composable.finance/)s 
to assist some of the most promising upcoming projects. 
Selected projects will receive full hands-on support from the entire Composable team in addition to funding.
