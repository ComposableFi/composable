# Build on Composable: Ecosystem Development

*To help usher in the interoperable future of DeFi, 
Composable Labs actively supports developers building projects with our technology. 
This includes projects using pallets on our Picasso parachain and those building with our cross-chain technology.*

Composable labs is devoted to pushing new protocols that harness the full potential of the Composable techstack.
Projects building on Composable:

- [Angular Finance](https://www.angular.finance/)

- [Instrumental Finance](https://www.instrumental.finance/)

## Composable Research

Composable Labs is always working towards advancing innovative ideas, 
identifying market trends, and discovering untapped potential. 
This is not only the case for in-house projects – Composable Labs works closely with incubated project teams to identify 
problems, shortcomings, and opportunities for new functionality or increased efficiency. 

Composable Labs have recently researched and developed Instrumental Finance’s pallet on Picasso. 
This benefits mainnet and EVM ecosystem users looking to farm yield on Picasso and DotSama. 
As Picasso-based pallets start offering liquidity rush events (LREs) and other strategies, 
Ethereum and other EVM communities can participate in these fresh APY opportunities without the hassle of installing a 
Polkadot.js wallet. 

Composable Labs works in tandem with our in-house lead cryptography researcher, 
[@Cryptoni0x](https://twitter.com/Cryptoni0x), who plays a crucial role in researching cryptographic primitives and the 
technology that surrounds it. Composable Labs are developing several primitives that will serve as fundamental DeFi 
products and services for users on Picasso.

As we work to confront MEV in the DeFi ecosystem and explore opportunities to leverage the idea for the good of 
Composable Finance, we will continue to research and discussions within our team and community. 
[You can check out this post](https://medium.com/@ComposableLabs/addressing-mev-in-composables-cross-layer-solution-b59f91fc46dc) 
by 0xbrainjar and CryptoNymph stating our team's approach to addressing MEV in the Composable ecosystem.

**Composable Labs will continue to grow its research presence and is always looking for individuals to add to their 
talent pool.**

## The Resources Provided To Developers:

The ingenuity of developers is at the core of DeFi’s growth towards a more end-user-friendly and optimized industry. 
As stated in the [announcement](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/picasso-f17705da670e) of our procurement of a parachain 
for Picasso, we see the potential for dApps built in our ecosystem only to be limited by a developer’s imagination. 
To untether this potential, it is essential to provide resources to improve the creative and developmental process.


Composable Labs is recruiting projects to build on Picasso. Individuals and teams can contribute to a cutting-edge 
ecosystem with the potential to win grants and developmental/marketing assistance. We invite community members and 
developers to build these pallets on Picasso, with the most promising projects being incubated by Composable Labs. 
Thus, developers can work with all of the tools they need to build powerful applications and receive the support to 
achieve success.


Beyond funding, developers working on Polkadot and Kusama will be given access to any of our existing pallets, 
such as our oracle and vault pallets, 
[Apollo](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/introducing-apollo-an-mev-resistant-oracle-884efae18848) and 
[Cubic](https://0xbrainjar.medium.com/introducing-cubic-setting-the-standard-for-vault-infrastructure-in-polkadot-and-kusama-8c1ab9390c5f). 
Developers working on Ethereum will get access to 
Once an Ethereum project reaches a particular stage of development, Composable’s team can also help port it to 
[Rust pallets](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/pallets) 
and deploy them on our parachain. Once the 
[Cross-Chain Virtual Machine (XCVM)](https://dali.devnets.composablefinance.ninja/products/xcvm.html) 
launches, this technology will also be available for developers to capitalize upon.


Along with the above tools and funds, a key piece of Composable’s value add for developers is the team we have to 
support you. Grant participants will be able to leverage the Composable team to assist with furthering their product 
development roadmap.
Additionally, in some of the most promising cases, we can jump in and build alongside teams we selected for our grants 
program. 
We are currently doing this with projects working with Composable Labs and plan to expand this offering to the grants 
program on a case by case basis.

To further support and incentivize the development on Picasso, 
we have launched[ Grant Program](https://grants.composable.finance/)s 
to assist some of the most promising upcoming projects. 
Selected projects will receive full hands-on support from the entire Composable team in addition to funding.
