INESC Lisboa is a research consortium based out of Lisbon, Portugal. Composable is collaborating with [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), a subset of INESC Lisboa that focuses on research, development, and innovation (R&D+i) in computer science and electrical and computer engineering. It specifically promotes collaboration between academia and industry. Composable is working with [Professor Miguel Matos](https://www.cienciavitae.pt/CD1F-6851-B224) and his team at INESC-ID to research and develop a number of cutting edge technologies, such as a mechanism for enabling chains without light clients to connect to the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.
