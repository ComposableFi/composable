## RFP : Canonical Stable Coin Design and Integration

### Introduction:

Composable Finance is seeking proposals from qualified blockchain developers 
to design and integrate a **Proof-of-Concept** for a custom stablecoin for multi-chain usage 
using our proprietary [Composable Virtual Machine(CVM)]. 
The goal of this project is to allow projects to create and maintain mint and burn privileges 
for issuing truly canonical stablecoins across different chains.

### Requirements & Scope of Work:

The purpose of this RFP is to build a **proof of concept** for a CVM-powered stablecoin for multi-chain usage.
Requirements for creating a custom CVM-powered stablecoin for multi-chain use are as follows:
- Design and develop a custom stablecoin for multi-chain usage using our technology stack, specifically the CVM 
- A minting contract must be on each chain that you want to mint your coin on
- An CVM contract must be on the chain of your choice in order to control mint and burn 
  via [Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)] Protocol messages between chains
  - This will handle the actual accounting of the stablecoin
