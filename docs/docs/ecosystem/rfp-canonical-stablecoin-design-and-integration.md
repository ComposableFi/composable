# Request for Proposal: Canonical Stable Coin Design and Integration

## Introduction:

Composable Finance is seeking proposals from qualified blockchain developers 
to design and integrate a **Proof-of-Concept** for a custom stablecoin for multi-chain usage 
using our proprietary [Cross-Chain Virtual Machine(XCVM)]. 
The goal of this project is to allow projects to create and maintain mint and burn privileges 
for issuing truly canonical stablecoins across different chains.

[Cross-Chain Virtual Machine(XCVM)]: https://docs.composable.finance/products/xcvm

## Requirements & Scope of Work:

The purpose of this RFP is to build a **proof of concept** for a XCVM-powered stablecoin for multi-chain usage.
Requirements for creating a custom XCVM-powered stablecoin for multi-chain use are as follows:
- Design and develop a custom stablecoin for multi-chain usage using our technology stack, specifically the XCVM 
- A minting contract must be on each chain that you want to mint your coin on
- An XCVM contract must be on the chain of your choice in order to control mint and burn 
  via [Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)] Protocol messages between chains
  - This will handle the actual accounting of the stablecoin
