# Overview

This tutorial describes part of MANTIS describing running solver node and user to post problems. 

## Solver node

Documentation to run solver node is located in https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable/blob/main/code/mantis/node/README.md .

Solver observer user orders on chain, and find matches, so they can exchange. 

If solver does not find match, formulates cross chain route.

## User posts problems

Example of problem you can see is here:

```json

// user asset
```

You can try live code with https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable/blob/main/code/cvm/mantis.ts .
