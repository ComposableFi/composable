# PICA Tokenomics

## PICA use cases

PICA is fundamental to governance, user dynamics, and network usage on the Picasso parachain. 


### Gas fees

Transaction fees (or gas) are payable in PICA.


### Governance

PICA will be used in voting to decide on key governance decisions, including:

* Pallet onboarding: which pallets can be incorporated on the Picasso parachain
* Pallet graduation: which pallets on Picasso will be able to “graduate” onto the Composable parachain
* Ecosystem growth: directing Treasury towards different initiatives in the ecosystem such as grants and incentivizing usage of the initial decentralized apps (dApps) on the network.
* Public goods infrastructure: powering infrastructure providers, block explorers, wallets, and other key ecosystem partners.

### Collator staking

Collators for the Picasso parachain are required to put down a stake to produce blocks on the Picasso parachain. In doing so, collators will earn PICA through transaction fees.

### Oracle staking

Oracle operators are required to put down stakes to provide price feeds. They will be rewarded/ slashed according to the accuracy of the data they provide.

### Liquidity provisioning

Users can provide liquidity for PICA-USDC, PICA-KSM pairs on the Pablo DEX for yield. 

## Total supply and genesis token distribution

The total supply of PICA is 10 billion tokens. PICA Token distribution is intended as follows:
