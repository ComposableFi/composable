These services, however, are not fully assured and extreme events and similar circumstances may prevent their realization.

To this extent, by engaging in any of the Covered Activities, you agree that you have no recourse, 
claim, action, judgment or remedy against the Company in relation to the utility of Composable Tokens.

You may lose all the funds, assets or value that you transferred in exchange for the Composable Tokens.
