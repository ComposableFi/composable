They are merely a means 
by which you may be able to utilize certain services in a network or platform to be operated by the Company(the “Project”). 
These services, however, are not fully assured and extreme events and similar circumstances may prevent their realization.

To this extent, by engaging in any of the Covered Activities, you agree that you have no recourse, 
claim, action, judgment or remedy against the Company in relation to the utility of Composable Tokens.

Should you be uncertain as to any information in the Materials or to your participation in the Covered Activities,

we strongly encourage and urge you not to engage in the Covered Activities.
You may lose all the funds, assets or value that you transferred in exchange for the Composable Tokens.
