# Risk Factors

Without limiting the generality of the factors enumerated below, you are hereby informed and made aware of all the 
potential risks and liabilities relating to the PICA tokens of Composable Finance Ltd. 
(the “Company”) `in the Picasso parachain in the Kusama network`.

In this regard, you assume, among others, the following potential risks and liabilities with respect to the PICA tokens, 
its performance or utility, and the Company’s operations within the Picasso parachain and all the projects built or 
established within its ecosystem, to wit:

1. **General commercial risks.** There is no guarantee that the Company's goals or objectives in relation to the PICA token 
   or its projects will be achieved. The development or deployment of the PICA token or its intended utility may fail, 
   be abandoned or be delayed for a number of reasons, including lack of funding, lack of commercial success or 
   prospects, or lack of use by advertisers, publishers, and/or users.

2. **Regulatory risks.** Cryptocurrencies are the subject of regulatory scrutiny by government authorities and other 
   regulatory bodies worldwide, and the Company could be adversely affected by one or more enquiries or actions.

3. **No intrinsic Value.** The PICA token has no intrinsic value and is not collateralized. 
   You should be aware that you may not be able to recover any amount or value that you exchange to acquire it. 
   All forms of participation in cryptocurrencies involve a substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.

4. **No guarantee on utility.** Expectations regarding the form and functionality of the PICA tokens or its intended 
   functionality and utility, may not be met upon its release for any number of reasons, including a change in the 
   design and implementation of plans, or delays or differences upon execution.

5. **Delay.** The full functionality and utility of the PICA tokens is not yet complete, and no assurance that such 
   can be completed in a timely manner or be completed at all. The intended functionality and utility of the PICA 
   tokens is complex and will require enhancements and product support over time, 
   and full functionality may take longer than expected.

6. **Not an Investment.** The PICA token, like all digital assets, are highly speculative and risky; they should not
   be considered as an investment vehicle or a financial instrument in any way.

7. **Reliability of information.**  Neither the Company, nor any related third party, provides any absolute guarantee 
   as to the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of the information and materials published relating to the PICA 
   tokens. While the Company makes a conscious effort in providing only updated information.

8. **Security.** The Company plans on implementing security measures; however, the Company cannot predict the success of
   any security precautions. For instance, the Company may lose access to its private keys or be subject to data breach 
   or data loss. In such a case, the Company does not accept any liability for any loss or damage whatsoever caused by 
   the lost access to the private keys or due to data breach or data loss.

9. **Advances in hacking capabilities.** Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of 
   quantum computing, may present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Company, which could result in the theft or loss of 
   PICA tokens.

10. **Irreversibility.** PICA token transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent
   and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the 
   processing power on the relevant blockchain. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is 
   added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of PICA Tokens will not be reversible, and there may be no 
   compensation for any such transfer or theft. Such loss could adversely affect the value of the PICA tokens.

11. **Market disruptions.** Market events such as those that occurred during October of 1987 and on September 11, 2001, 
   could have a global material effect on general conditions and market liquidity which could result in substantial 
   losses or total loss of value of the PICA tokens.

12. **No Control.**  The PICA tokens are not securities or shares and do not represent any stake in the Company. 
   All decisions regarding the management and affairs of the Company will be made exclusively by the Company. 
   You will have no right or power to take part in the management, direction or control of the Company, which may 
   affect the rights, utility or value of the PICA tokens that you may own or hold.
