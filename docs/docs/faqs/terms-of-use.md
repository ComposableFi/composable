Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause

Such factors include, among others, general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties;

changes to the tax and other regulatory requirements regarding DeFi and the industry as a whole.
While the Company considers these facts and assumptions to be reasonably based on information currently available to it, 
these assumptions may prove to be incorrect. 
Actual results may vary from such forward-looking information for a variety of reasons,

risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control.

6. Forward-Looking Statements

This information contains “forward-looking statements. ” These statements, identified by words such as “plan,” 
“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “should,” “expect,” “will,” “can,” and similar future-looking expressions 
include our expectations and objectives regarding our future operating results and business strategy. 
Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may 
cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Composable and its affiliated entities or related projects 
to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the 
forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, general business, economic, competitive, political and 
social uncertainties; dependence on commercial product interest; as well as regulatory or legal changes and uncertainty. 
Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions, economic conditions in the near
to medium future, the average cost of the Company’s offerings compared to traditional offerings, 
fluctuations or changes to the tax and other regulatory requirements regarding DeFi and the industry as a whole.
While the Company considers these facts and assumptions to be reasonably based on information currently available to it, 
these assumptions may prove to be incorrect. Actual results may vary from such forward-looking information for a 
variety of reasons, including but not limited to risks and uncertainties known and unknown by the Company. 
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, 
risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. 
The Company’s actual results and conditions may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements.
