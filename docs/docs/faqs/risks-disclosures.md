“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “should,” “expect”, “will”, “can”, and similar future-looking expressions include 
our expectations and objectives regarding our future operating results and business strategy. Forward-looking statements 
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, 
performance or achievements of Composable Finance Ltd. and its affiliated entities or related projects (“Composable”, or
the “Company”) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by 
the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, general business, economic, competitive, political 
and social uncertainties; dependence on commercial product interest; as well as regulatory or legal changes and 
uncertainty.  Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions, economic conditions 
in the near to medium future, the average cost of the Company’s offerings compared to traditional offerings, 
fluctuations or changes to the tax and other regulatory requirements regarding DeFi and the industry as a whole. 
While the Company considers these facts and assumptions to be reasonably based on information currently available to it,
these assumptions may prove to be incorrect. Actual results may vary from such forward-looking information for a variety
of reasons, including but not limited to risks and uncertainties known and unknown by the Company. Because 
forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in 
circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. The Company’s actual results 
and conditions may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not 
rely on any of these forward-looking statements.
