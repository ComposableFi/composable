Any views or opinions represented in the Material belong solely to the author or publisher, unless explicitly stated.

The Company disclaims all possible liability arising from such views, opinions and/or comments

5. **Forward-Looking Statements**

The Material may contain “forward-looking statements.” These statements, identified by words such as 
“plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “should,” “expect,” “will,” “can,” and similar future-looking expressions 
include our expectations and objectives regarding our future operating results and business strategy. 
Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors 
that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company and its affiliated entities 
or related projects to be materially different from any future results, 
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
Such factors include, among others, general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; 
dependence on commercial product interest; as well as regulatory or legal changes and uncertainty. 
Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions, 
economic conditions in the near to medium future, 
the average cost of the Company’s offerings compared to traditional offerings, fluctuations or changes to the tax 
and other regulatory requirements regarding DeFi and the industry as a whole. 
While the Company considers these facts and assumptions to be reasonably based on information currently available to it,
these assumptions may prove to be incorrect. 
Actual results may vary from such forward-looking information for a variety of reasons, 
including but not limited to risks and uncertainties known and unknown by the Company. 
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, 
risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. 
The Company’s actual results and conditions may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. 
Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements.

6. **Technological Risks**

You acknowledge that if you rely on, or use information contained in this Material, you unequivocally represent that 
you understand (1) the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems 
which are independent public peer-to-peer networks and are not subject to regulation or control by any authority, 
and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets and digital tokens; 
(2) that the markets for these digital assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) 
adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation;
(3) that the Company’s underlying software and software application are still in an early development stage and unproven
and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain 
weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of digital assets and tokens; 
(4) that any loans or investments made in digital assets or related technologies are subject to 
significant risks of losses and past performance is no guarantee of future results; 
(5) the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value and you may
suffer large and immediate financial loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool,
and may experience price slippage and cost; 
(6) that it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position quickly at a reasonable price; 
(7) that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim 
to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens; 
and (8) that digital assets and tokens may be subject to expropriation and/or theft by 
hackers or other malicious groups by obstructing the token smart contract which creates the tokens in a variety of ways,
including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.
