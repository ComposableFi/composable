**1. Specific Disclaimers**

**a. Not a Security or Investment Contract**

PICA tokens are not shares or securities of any type and they do not entitle you to any ownership or interest in the 
Company. They are merely a means by which you may be able to utilize certain services in a network or platform to be 
operated by the Company (the “Project”). These services, however, are not fully assured and extreme events and similar 
circumstances may prevent their realization.

To this extent, by engaging in any of the Covered Activities, you agree that you have no 
recourse, claim, action, judgment or remedy against the Company in relation to the utility of PICA tokens.

Should you be uncertain as to any information in the Materials or to your participation in the Covered Activities, 
or if you are not prepared to lose all funds, assets or value that you transferred in acquiring the PICA tokens, 
we strongly encourage and urge you not to engage in the Covered Activities. 
You may lose all  the funds, assets or value that you transferred in exchange for the PICA tokens.


**b. Not an Offering**

Any information in the Materials, especially as they relate to the PICA token, does not constitute an offer to sell or
a solicitation of an offer to purchase securities, assets, including digital assets, or financial instruments by the 
Company, or to enter into a transaction involving any such security or financial instrument. 
Such an offer can only be done through a registered or licensed offering or subject to an exemption.

Covered Activities.

or that any token sale or token generation event may be considered as offering of a security by the Company therein and,
as such, possibly be deemed as a regulated or prohibited activity. If such is the case, the Company shall not be held 
liable or responsible for the violation of any securities laws whatsoever.

restrictions on the acquisition of PICA tokens (as may be determined by the Company from time to time).

trust, corporation, entity, government, state or agency of a state or any other incorporated or unincorporated body or 
association, association or partnership (whether or not having separate legal personality) that is established and/or

## Risk Factors

Without limiting the generality of the factors enumerated below, you are hereby informed and made aware of all the
potential risks and liabilities relating to the PICA tokens of Composable Finance Ltd.
(the “Company”) `in the Picasso parachain in the Kusama network`.

In this regard, you assume, among others, the following potential risks and liabilities with respect to the PICA tokens,
its performance or utility, and the Company’s operations within the Picasso parachain and all the projects built or
established within its ecosystem, to wit:

1. **General commercial risks.** There is no guarantee that the Company's goals or objectives in relation to the PICA 
    token or its projects will be achieved. The development or deployment of the PICA token or its intended utility may 
    fail, be abandoned or be delayed for a number of reasons, including lack of funding, lack of commercial success or
    prospects, or lack of use by advertisers, publishers, and/or users.

2. **Regulatory risks.** Cryptocurrencies are the subject of regulatory scrutiny by government authorities and other
    regulatory bodies worldwide, and the Company could be adversely affected by one or more enquiries or actions.

3. **No intrinsic Value.** The PICA token has no intrinsic value and is not collateralized.
    You should be aware that you may not be able to recover any amount or value that you exchange to acquire it.
    All forms of participation in cryptocurrencies involve a substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.

4. **No guarantee on utility.** Expectations regarding the form and functionality of the PICA tokens or its intended
    functionality and utility, may not be met upon its release for any number of reasons, including a change in the
    design and implementation of plans, or delays or differences upon execution.

5. **Delay.** The full functionality and utility of the PICA tokens is not yet complete, and no assurance that such
    can be completed in a timely manner or be completed at all. The intended functionality and utility of the PICA
    tokens is complex and will require enhancements and product support over time,
    and full functionality may take longer than expected.

6. **Not an Investment.** The PICA token, like all digital assets, are highly speculative and risky; they should not
    be considered as an investment vehicle or a financial instrument in any way.

7. **Reliability of information.**  Neither the Company, nor any related third party, provides any absolute guarantee
    as to the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of the information and materials published relating to the PICA
    tokens. While the Company makes a conscious effort in providing only updated information.

8. **Security.** The Company plans on implementing security measures; however, the Company cannot predict the success of
    any security precautions. For instance, the Company may lose access to its private keys or be subject to data breach
    or data loss. In such a case, the Company does not accept any liability for any loss or damage whatsoever caused by
    the lost access to the private keys or due to data breach or data loss.

9. **Advances in hacking capabilities.** Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of
    quantum computing, may present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Company, which could result in the theft or loss of
    PICA tokens.

10. **Irreversibility.** PICA token transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent
    and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the
    processing power on the relevant blockchain. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is
    added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of PICA Tokens will not be reversible, and there may be no
    compensation for any such transfer or theft. Such loss could adversely affect the value of the PICA tokens.

11. **Market disruptions.** Market events such as those that occurred during October of 1987 and on September 11, 2001,
    could have a global material effect on general conditions and market liquidity which could result in substantial
    losses or total loss of value of the PICA tokens.

12. **No Control.**  The PICA tokens are not securities or shares and do not represent any stake in the Company.
    All decisions regarding the management and affairs of the Company will be made exclusively by the Company.
    You will have no right or power to take part in the management, direction or control of the Company, which may
    affect the rights, utility or value of the PICA tokens that you may own or hold.
