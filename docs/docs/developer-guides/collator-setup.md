# Picasso Collator Set-up Guide

In this document we will cover how to set up a collator with Composable Finance.
Please follow the steps below to get set up.

## 1) Select (virtual hardware)

To run a collator, Composable recommends a minimum of 2 CPUs, 6 GB of memory, 
and 600 GB of storage (will increase over time)

## 2) Generate a new node key

If you don‚Äôt have subkey installed, these steps will build it on an ubuntu machine:
```shell
sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev build-essential protobuf-codegen protobuf-compiler 


curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
#Choose -> 1) Proceed with installation (default)
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup default stable
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
rustup show
# Here we should see two toolchains installed; stable and nightly
rustup +nightly show
# Here we should see wasm32 and x86_64 installed targets


git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git
cd substrate


cargo +nightly build --package subkey --release
./target/release/subkey --help
```

For more details on subkey please see https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/

You can now use subkey to generate node keys for a node.
```shell
$ ./target/release/subkey generate-node-key --file /tmp/not_a_real_key
12D3KooWLp9aJBC7Jury1EgBYT4prqThmKPyB1Fm2fpBPUok1tKb
```
The file will contain the node key and the output( 

12D3KooWLp9aJBC7Jury1EgBYT4prqThmKPyB1Fm2fpBPUok1tKb

)above is the node identity.

Copy the key file to the machine that will run the collator and place it in a safe location. 

`/home/composable/node-key` is used in the example below.

## 3) Run the collator

Below is a docker compose file to run the application.
```yaml
services:
  composable_node:
    image: composablefi/composable:${COMPOSABLE_VERSION}
    container_name: composable_node
    volumes:
    - /var/lib/composable-data:/data
    - /home/composable/node-key:/node-key
    ports:
    - 9933:9933
    - 9944:9944
    - 30334:30334
    - 30333:30333
    - 9615:9615
    restart: unless-stopped
    command:  >
      /bin/composable ${COMPOSABLE_FLAGS}
    networks:
    - composable_network




networks:
  composable_network:
    name: composable_network
    driver: bridge
```
An environment file can be used to pass in the two variables above (COMPOSABLE_FLAGS and COMPOSABLE_VERSION).  

Alternatively, the values can be placed directly in the file.
```yaml
COMPOSABLE_FLAGS="--chain=picasso --name=partner-collator --listen-addr=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30334 --prometheus-external --prometheus-port 9615 --base-path /data --execution=wasm --collator --pruning=archive --node-key-file=/node-key -- --execution=wasm --listen-addr=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30333 "
COMPOSABLE_VERSION="v2.10009.0"
```
**Make sure to change the name parameter to be something unique to you.**

With the compose information in "docker-compose.yml" and the environment information in a file called "environment",

run the following command to start the application:
```shell
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
sudo docker-compose --env-file environment up -d
```
To see logs:

```shell
sudo docker logs -f $(sudo docker ps |grep composable|awk '{print $1}')
```
The latest version of the application can be found at  
https://hub.docker.com/r/composablefi/composable/tags or https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable/releases/.

This configuration will pass the key into the Composable application at startup. 
Verify that it is being used by checking the log for

```shell
[Parachain] üè∑ Local node identity is: 12D3KooWLp9aJBC7Jury1EgBYT4prqThmKPyB1Fm2fpBPUok1tKb
```

## 4) Verify that the node is running and catching up

Go to https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/0x6811a339673c9daa897944dcdac99c6e2939cc88245ed21951a0a3c9a2be75bc

From that site, you should be able to see your node, based on the name you assigned it above, 
and verify that it is catching up.

## 5) Verify that the http RPC port is available

```shell
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "rpc_methods"}' http://127.0.0.1:9933/
```
If this does not return anything, you may need to temporarily enable a few flags

```yaml
--rpc-external \
--unsafe-rpc-external \
--rpc-methods=unsafe \
```

## 6) Collator session key

On each new collator, run:
```shell
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys" }' http://127.0.0.1:9933/
```
Use the resulting session key in the next step.

## 7) Link node(s) to wallet(s)

Go to polkadot js, at https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpicasso-rpc.composable.finance#/explorer. 

Go to "Developer" ‚ûù "extrinsics". As the wallet account, run session setKeys(). 

Use the result from above as the Key and for the proof, enter "0x"

Make sure you are running your node in collator mode, then provide the Public address of your collator wallet to 
Composable so it can be added as an approved collator.
