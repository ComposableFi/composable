# Walkthrough: cw20_base

In this walkthrough, we will upload and interact with `cw20_base` contract. We will do:
* Fetch the contract binary from a running Cosmos chain and upload it to our chain.
* Instantiate the contract.
* Execute a transfer.

## Running `pallet-cosmwasm` in local

You can run our devnet locally following this guide: https://docs.composable.finance/nix.

## Uploading the contract

Let's say that we want to upload the `v1.0.1` release of `cw20_base`. We can directly use the download link
from the [release page](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/releases).

```sh
ccw substrate -c ws://127.0.0.1:9988 -n alice tx upload --url https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/releases/download/v1.0.1/cw20_base.wasm
```

Output:

```
[ + ] Contract uploaded.
    - Code Hash: 0x12f7â€¦1f73
        - Code ID: 1
```


## Instantiating the contract

The next step is to instantiate the contract so that we have an instance of the contract that we can execute and query. The upload command returned a code ID. This code
ID is used to identify the wasm binary (compiled CosmWasm contract). We will use this code ID to instantiate the contract from.

We want to use the following configurations to instantiate the contract:

- Code ID: `1` which is returned from the previous upload command.
- Salt: Just a random salt.
- Label: Let's say that it is "our-fancy-cw20base-contract".
- Maximum gas: We don't care, let's set it to `10000000000`
- Instantiate message: Let's instantiate a PICA token and give some initial balance to Bob's account
```json
{
  "name": "Picasso",
  "symbol": "PICA",
  "decimals": 6,
  "initial_balances": [
    {
      "amount": "1000000000000",
      "address": "0x8eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc5287613693c912909cb226aa4794f26a48"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that in the instantiate message, we used a hexadecimal address. That is the hexadecimal representation of the ordinary SS58 public key. We will soon
make use of SS58 representations in the contracts as well, but for now, this is how we do it.

So the command will be:
```sh
ccw substrate -c ws://127.0.0.1:9988 -n alice \
    tx instantiate \
    -c 1 \
    -s random-salt \
    -l our-fancy-cw20base-contract \
    -g 10000000000 \
    -m '{"name":"Picasso","symbol":"PICA","decimals":6,"initial_balances":[{"amount":"1000000000000","address":"0x8eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc5287613693c912909cb226aa4794f26a48"}]}'
```

Note that apart from the address of the contract that is instantiated, we also get the raw CosmWasm events.

Output:
```
[ + ] Contract instantiated.
    - Contract address: 5EszMeNDPmy4orcLEHRLiJawAt5xAvfK5VH7REV8bpB1jtjX
- Event: instantiate
    - Contract: 5EszMeNDPmy4orcLEHRLiJawAt5xAvfK5VH7REV8bpB1jtjX
    - Attributes:
        - _contract_address: 0x7c888b21f31f0cec5149830bb0f8f20b949e2b589c240d223625f53df694ca49
        - code_id: 1
```

## Execute a transfer

Let's transfer some amount from `Bob` to `Charlie`.

Note that as the signer, we need to use `bob` instead of `alice` because the signer here will be both the `signer` of the extrinsic, and the `sender`
of the contract message. Since we want to transfer from `bob`, `bob` needs to be the caller of the `execute` call.

Also, the contract address used here is `5EszMeNDPmy4orcLEHRLiJawAt5xAvfK5VH7REV8bpB1jtjX` which should be the same for you as well since the algorithm for the address
generation that we use is based on the instantiate parameters that we provide, not on some random values or chain state. But if for some reason, you get a different
address, use that address to execute the contract.

```sh
ccw substrate -c ws://127.0.0.1:9988 -n bob \
    tx execute \
    -c  5EszMeNDPmy4orcLEHRLiJawAt5xAvfK5VH7REV8bpB1jtjX \
    -g 10000000000 \
    -m '{"transfer":{"amount":"1000","recipient":"0xd64439add16b49b6b68ac74e1b28a73a8491501ab7e0e829716f580947a4bd7e"}}'
```

Output:
```
[ + ] Contract executed.
- Event: execute
    - Contract: 5EszMeNDPmy4orcLEHRLiJawAt5xAvfK5VH7REV8bpB1jtjX
    - Attributes:

        - amount: 1000
        - _contract_address: 0x7c888b21f31f0cec5149830bb0f8f20b949e2b589c240d223625f53df694ca49
```
  
  
## Query the balance

Although you can see that the events clearly show the transfer happened. Let's query the contract to check out our balance to make sure. Since the query is not a transaction
but an RPC call, we'll use the subcommand `rpc` instead of `tx`.

Note that we are using a different protocol and port for the RPC endpoint.

```
ccw substrate -c http://127.0.0.1:32200 \
    rpc query \
    -c 5EszMeNDPmy4orcLEHRLiJawAt5xAvfK5VH7REV8bpB1jtjX \
    -g 10000000000 \
    -q '{"balance":{"address":"0xd64439add16b49b6b68ac74e1b28a73a8491501ab7e0e829716f580947a4bd7e"}}'
```

Output:
```
ccw substrate -c http://127.0.0.1:32200 \
    rpc query \
    -c 5EszMeNDPmy4orcLEHRLiJawAt5xAvfK5VH7REV8bpB1jtjX \
    -g 100000000 \
    -q '{"balance":{"address":"0xd64439add16b49b6b68ac74e1b28a73a8491501ab7e0e829716f580947a4bd7e"}}'
```
