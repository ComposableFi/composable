# Polkadot

Polkadot is a blockchain of blockchains. Instead of executing smart contracts directly, it allows other chains to connect and verifies the integrity of the connected chains. We refer to this as 'shared security'.

Navigate to the [wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-accounts), and make sure to at least cover all the topics listed under `basics`. These include `Accounts`, `Tokens and Assets`, `Components`, and `Staking`.

## Composable and Picasso

Parachains are a part of our product. We use these as bridging hubs for our `XCVM` network, as well as an execution layer for DeFi protocols. Initially, we won two slots, the Picasso (Kusama) slot #13: leasing November 30, 2021 - November 2, 2022, and the Composable (Polkadot) slot #8: leasing March 11, 2022 - January 16, 2024.

Some products that we are building and deploying on Picasso and Composable include:

- [Centauri](https://dali.devnets.composablefinance.ninja/products/centauri-overview.html)
- [XCVM](https://dali.devnets.composablefinance.ninja/products/xcvm.html)
- [CosmWasmVM](https://dali.devnets.composablefinance.ninja/products/xcvm/writing-smart-contracts-with-cosmwasm.html)

In conjunction with our main projects, Composable Labs is incubating more projects to deploy on our chains.

## Acala

A parachain focussed on DeFi and stablecoins, and one of our partners in the DeFi space. Read through their [wiki](https://wiki.acala.network/) on the different products as well as their EVM+.

## Moonbeam

Another major parachain, focusing on being an Ethereum compatible execution layer. Many protocols jumped over to moonbeam because they did not have to rewrite their contracts.

Peruse their [wiki](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/) too.
