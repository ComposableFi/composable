# Working at Composable

We hope that the learning during the onboarding was challenging and useful to you. Working at Composable is challenging and a lot of fun. Some advice as you start your journey, regardless of the team you'll be working in:

1. Working remotely is hard. Hard for us to keep track of your progress, as well as hard for you since there are fewer opportunities to ask questions or drop by someone's office. The key to working remotely is disciplined communication. Let your team know what you are working on (or stuck on), and if you see others struggle or ask questions on slack, help them out. It is also hard to keep track of decisions made, so use `Github`'s discussions and PRs to discuss features, instead of slack or during calls. Even if you don't work as a developer, make sure to use appropriate tools. Try to always have one source of truth (SoT) regarding decisions and work, instead of multiple out-of-date documents.

2. Ownership is important. It is not your boss who is responsible for delivering a product, it is all of us together. If you're a developer reading some code that your colleagues wrote, question the quality, security, and workings of it. If you're a technical writer, realize that your work is the face of Composable.

3. Have fun. Working far apart from each other can make it difficult to have casual conversations, or daunting to approach someone. Going to conferences is a great way to get to know the others, as well as organizing social events with your team, such as a gaming session.
