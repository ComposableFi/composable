### Takeaways

Understand that tokens are not magical and that your wallet just manages your private key but doesn't actually `hold` the assets. 

## LP tokens and NFTs

Some tokens don't represent a currency, but more of a share of an asset, such as stocks. These are still fungible assets. The equivalent to a `stock` in crypto is an LP token, which represents fractional ownership of a larger pool of other tokens.

NFTs are a different standard, but the same as `erc-20` tokens, except the total supply is always 1. These can be used to express non-fungible assets. An example of a non-fungible asset is a house. Even though we have housing markets, each house must be priced differently (different number of rooms, location, etc.).

### Takeaways

Tokens are financial instruments and can be used to express many different financial concepts. NFTs fall in the same category, even though they are now primarily used for artworks.
