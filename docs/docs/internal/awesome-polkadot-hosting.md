# Overview

To run, any chain needs:

- genesis state (to be shared with cluster of nodes which form consensus)
- runtime to execute (logic of)
- bootstrap networking information (which nodes to connect)
- and, either relay setup or what relay to use
- and other useful setup like logging, metrics
- private keys in keystore 
- logical network connectivity allowance (bridges)

There are guides and tools which help to make life easier
