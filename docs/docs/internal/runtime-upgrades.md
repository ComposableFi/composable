# Overview

Upgrading runtime of parachain connected to relay via democracy.

Most operations can be done via `polkadot.js` `Governance` tab for `Council` and  `Democracy` which is well documented by Parity. 

Here we do outline directly pallets extrinsics calls.

### General flow

1. Send to chain desire to update.
2. Make that desire be voted
3. Vote
4. Enact

#### Preparing preimage

```scale
preimage_hash = parachainSystem.authorizeUpgrade(BlakeTwo256(wasm))
democracy_proposal_hash = democracy.notePreimage(set_code_preimage)
```

Store all values out of process and share `wasm` reference, ***preimage_hash*** and encoded extrinsics with relevant channels.

#### Council collective (optional)

***council (main) member*** do next on chain:

```scale
# motion to propose default YES vote on democracy to apply new runtime code
proposal_hash = council.propose(democracy.externalProposeDefault(democracy_proposal_hash))
```

others if any needed do:

```scale
council.vote(proposal_hash)
```

and after to enact it to start voting:

```scale
council.close(proposal_hash)
```

#### Technical collective (optional)

```scale
referendum = democracy.fastTrack(proposal_hash, ..)
```

### PICA holders

```scale
democracy.vote(referendum)
```

### Technical (Optional)

Actually it is done by scheduler, but technical can try enact it earlier

```scale
democracy.enactProposal
```

### Upload runtime

After proposal enacted,

`parachainSystem.enactAuthorizedUpgrade` can be called by anybody with wasm file. 

If runtime upgrade is big(count on migrations), run it via `scheduler`.
