# "Internal" Docs

Documentation that neither fits the published [docs](../) nor can sit at the place where the code base is located (like some cross pallet cross-chain stuff).
Usually, it is not marketable and is more technical than it would fit the book. Neither it is not as technical as pallets or contract documents.

These docs are not internal in the sense that they are private within Composable Finance, since everything we do is open source, but they are not listed in the public sidebar at [docs.composable.finance](https://docs.composable.finance), and are instead accessed by going to [docs.composable.finance/internal](https://docs.composable.finance/internal)
