Mosaic V1 was the first version of the Cross-layer transferal system, launched on September 14th, 2021, as a proof of concept. Mosaic is crafted on the foundations of the Composable infrastructure. Our vision is that Mosaic will be the cross-layer liquidity solution underpinning Ethereum Union transfers, solving complexities for developers and abstracting away hurdles of inefficiency.

Mosaic V2 is the second version of the Cross-layer transferal system and comes with extra features such as: withdrawing liquidity on any layer, in any token, transfer & swap, NFT transfers, cross-layer function calls, provide active & passive liquidity on all layers and produce additional yield from farming with the unused funds.
