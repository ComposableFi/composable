# Overview

Do not use the default configuration when starting a new devcontainer.
Peek one of `Configure and create codespace -> Dev container configuration -> .devcontianer/<peek preffered>`.

Substrate, smart contracts, XCVM  developers and testers have different setups, which nudge to split jobs via containers.
Organized roughly according [GitHub teams](../.github/CODEOWNERS).
