# Development

## Quickstart

- `yarn start` to run the app

## Storybook

There are two ways to run your storybook:

- `yarn storybook` to run the storybook

- `yarn storybook:build` to build the storybook

## Testing

There are two ways to test your application:

- `yarn test` to run the tests

- `yarn test:watch` to run the tests in watch mode

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: Wiring between storybook and Jest is done, check out the example `tests/pages/home.test.tsx` for more information.

## Running the app

There are multiple scripts ready to use on your first tryout.

- `yarn start` to launch the development server
- `yarn build` to build production
- `yarn lint` to run the linter

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `yarn install` will trigger `.scripts/postinstall.js` script. Which contains important checks on whether you need to update certain configurations. It is strongly advised to make sure that script doesnâ€™t throw any warnings, or in case of the warning, resolve them ASAP before going live.
