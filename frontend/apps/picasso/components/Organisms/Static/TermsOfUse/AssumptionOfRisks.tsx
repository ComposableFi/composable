    <NormalText>You represent and warrant that you:</NormalText>
    <List>
      <LatinListItem>
        Have the necessary technical expertise and ability to review and
        evaluate the security, integrity and operation of any transactions that
        you engage in through the Site or Services;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Have the knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice and
        information to make your own evaluation of the merits, risks and
        applicable compliance requirements under applicable law of engaging in
        transactions through the Site or Services;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand and agree to the inherent risks associated with cryptographic
        systems and blockchain-based networks, digital assets, including the
        usage and intricacies of native digital assets, smart contract-based
        tokens (including fungible tokens and NFTs), and systems that interact
        with blockchain-based networks. Composable does not own or control all
        of the underlying software through which other blockchain networks are
        formed. For example, the software underlying certain blockchain networks
        is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute
        it;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge that Composable’s underlying software and software
        application, including the Digital Assets such as the financial NFTs
        (“fNFTs”), are still new, unproven and in the early development stage.
        There is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses,
        vulnerabilities, or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of the
        Digital Assets, or the risk the Digital Assets may not have their
        intended functionalities or may have no functions at all;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge that any use or interaction with the Services requires a
        comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science
        to appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You
        represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills.
        Any reference to a type of digital asset on the Site or otherwise during
        the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of
        the technology on which the digital asset relies, and should not be used
        as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each
        type of digital asset;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with
        advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the
        development of quantum computers, which may present risks to digital
        assets and the Services, and could result in the theft or loss of your
        digital assets. To the extent possible, we intend to update
        Composable-developed smart contracts related to the Services to account
        for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security
        measures necessary to address risks presented from technological
        advancements, but that intention does not guarantee or otherwise ensure
        full security of the Services;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge and agree that (a) Composable is not solely responsible for
        the operation of the blockchain-based software and networks underlying
        the Services, (b) there exists no guarantee of the functionality,
        security, or availability of that software and networks, and (c) the
        underlying blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in
        operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” which
        may materially affect the Services;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand that Pablo and the Picasso parachain remains under
        development, which creates technological and security risks when using
        the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to digital assets and
        transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting in
        Pablo and the Picasso parachain is variable and may increase at any time
        causing impact to any activities taking place therein, which may result
        in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand that blockchain networks use public and private key
        cryptography. Thus, you alone are responsible for securing your private
        key(s). We do not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of
        your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to
        any of your digital assets on the network. Neither Composable nor any
        other person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your digital
        assets. If your private key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to
        transfer your digital assets to any other blockchain address or wallet.
        If this occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value or
        utility from the digital assets that you may hold;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand that the markets for these digital assets are highly volatile
        due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation,
        technology, security, and regulation;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Confirm that you are solely responsible for your use of the Services,
        including all of your transfers of Digital Assets and all the trades you
        place, including any erroneous orders that may be filled. We do not take
        any action to resolve erroneous trades or transfers that result from
        your mistake or inadvertence;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge that Composable’s underlying software and software
        application are still in an early development stage and unproven. There
        is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses,
        vulnerabilities, or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of
        digital assets and tokens.
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and that you are
        solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Services or
        Site. This warning and other warnings that Composable provides in these
        Terms are in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you
        to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Services or accessing the
        Site;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand all the risks relating to supplying Digital Assets to a
        liquidity to a liquidity pool including the risk of impermanent loss
        wherein the value of one Digital Asset rises in comparison to the other
        resulting in the assets being worth less in paper which may become
        permanent if you withdraw liquidity before the price stabilizes;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge and accept that these Digital Assets, especially the fNFTs,
        are relatively new innovations and technologies in DeFi whose regulatory
        treatment are presently uncertain, which could lead to them being
        considered as securities and subject to restrictions under applicable
        law concerning their purchase, sale, trade and related transactions. Any
        unintended violation of law may lead to enforcement action and
        penalties. Also, there is a risk with new technologies that they may not
        function entirely as intended or create unknown risks;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge and accept the risk that your digital assets may lose some
        or all of their value while they are supplied to the App, you may suffer
        large and immediate financial loss due to the fluctuation of prices of
        Digital Assets in a liquidity pool or trading pair, and may experience
        price slippage and cost. Thus, you should not hold value you cannot
        afford to lose in digital assets;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Agree and accept that the Services and your digital assets could be
        impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions,
        which could impede or limit the ability of Composable to continue to
        make available our proprietary software and could impede or limit your
        ability to access or use the Services;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of
        existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and
        acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or
        other tokens;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand that digital assets and tokens may be subject to
        expropriation and/or theft by hackers or other malicious groups by
        obstructing the token smart contract which creates the tokens in a
        variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial
        of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and
        spoofing;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand and accept that DEXes require no form of Know-Your-Customer
        due diligence before users can trade and anyone with a crypto wallet can
        trade on DEXes without any discrimination, which, thus, may potentially
        increase the risk of interacting with malicious or fraudulent users;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge that DEXes, because of their decentralized nature, are not
        presently subject to comprehensive regulation;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with
        cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase
        at any time;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand and accept that you are solely responsible for reporting and
        paying any taxes applicable to your use of the Services;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Confirm and accept that there are risks associated with the use of the
        Site and Services that Composable cannot anticipate. Such risks may
        appear as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks
        discussed above;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand and accept that Composable has the right to disable or modify
        access to the Site and the Services (such as restricting features of the
        Services) at any time in the event of any breach of these Terms,
        including, if we reasonably believe any of your representations and
        warranties may be untrue or inaccurate, and we will not be liable to you
        for any losses or damages you may suffer as a result of or in connection
        with the Site or the Services being inaccessible to you at any time or
        for any reason;
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Understand that the Site and the Services may evolve, which means
        Composable may apply changes, replace, or discontinue (temporarily or
        permanently) the Services at any time in our sole discretion; and
      </LatinListItem>
      <LatinListItem>
        Assume, and agree that Composable will have no responsibility or
        liability for any and all the risks associated with the use of the Site
        and Services, including, but not limited to the above and you hereby
        irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or
        unknown to you, against Composable, its affiliates and their respective
        shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and
        representatives related to any of the risks set forth herein.
