      Under no circumstances shall Composable or any of its officers, directors,
      employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable for
      any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary
      damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits,
      goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out of or
      relating to any access or use of the Site, nor will Composable be
      responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking,
      tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Site or the
      information contained within it. Composable assumes no liability or
      responsibility for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;
      (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever,
      resulting from any access or use of the Site; (c) unauthorized access or
      use of any secure server or database in our control, or the use of any
      information or data stored therein; (d) interruption or cessation of
      function related to the Site; (e) bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the
      like that may be transmitted to or through the Site; (f) errors or
      omissions in, or loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of, any
      content made available through the Site; and (g) the defamatory,
      offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party. Under no circumstances
      shall Composable or any of its officers, directors, employees,
      contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any
      claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs
      in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to us in exchange for access to
      and use of the Site, or USD$50.00, whichever is greater. This limitation
      of liability applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based
      on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and
      even if we have been advised of the possibility of such liability. Some
      jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
      limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly,
      some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in these Terms may not
      apply to you. This limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest
      extent permitted by law.
