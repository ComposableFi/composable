      This information contains “forward-looking statements.” These statements,
      identified by words such as “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,”
      “should,” “expect,” “will,” “can,” and similar future-looking expressions
      include our expectations and objectives regarding our future operating
      results and business strategy. Forward-looking statements involve known
      and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may
      cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Composable and
      its affiliated entities or related projects to be materially different
      from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
      by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others,
      general business, economic, competitive, political and social
      uncertainties; dependence on commercial product interest; as well as
      regulatory or legal changes and uncertainty. Forward-looking statements
      are based on a number of material factors and assumptions, economic
      conditions in the near to medium future, the average cost of the Company’s
      offerings compared to traditional offerings, fluctuations or changes to
      the tax and other regulatory requirements regarding DeFi and the industry
      as a whole. While the Company considers these facts and assumptions to be
      reasonably based on information currently available to it, these
      assumptions may prove to be incorrect. Actual results may vary from such
      forward-looking information for a variety of reasons, including but not
      limited to risks and uncertainties known and unknown by the Company.
      Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject
      to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are
      difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. The
      Company’s actual results and conditions may differ materially from those
      indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not
      rely on any of these forward-looking statements.
