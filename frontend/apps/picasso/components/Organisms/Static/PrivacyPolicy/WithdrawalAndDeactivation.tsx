      If you decide to withdraw your consent for the Company to use and/or
      disclose all your Personal Data, we will cease to collect your information
      unless there is a legal justification for the continued collection of your
      Personal Data. Further, we may not be able to continue providing our
      Services to you or continue any contractual relationship that is in place
      depending on the nature of your request. The withdrawal of your consent
      may result in the termination of any agreements with us and it may be
      considered as a breach of your contractual obligations or undertakings. In
      such instance, we reserve our legal right to pursue any remedies available
      at law or in equity. The withdrawal of your consent does not in any way
      affect the lawfulness of the collection of your data based on the consent
      given prior to the withdrawal.
