	// - put relevant rust code behind cfg target wasm into this package
	// - create separate native package which will include bytes of WASM_BINARY (make it read from
	//   target depending on cfg of build debug/release)
	// - make cargo make to build this package for wasm target with all proper env vars
	// - make sure that CI/CD gets wasm only via make file to make builds more reproducible
	// - document that maximal reproducability is possible if to build in layered docker
