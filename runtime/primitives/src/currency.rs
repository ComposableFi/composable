//! CurrencyId implementation
/// Asset id as if it was deserialized, not necessary exists.
/// We could check asset id during serde, but that:
/// - will make serde setup complicated (need to write and consistently apply static singletons
///   to all places with asset id)
/// - validate will involve at minimum in memory cache call (in worth case db call) during
///   extrinsic invocation
/// - will need to disable this during calls when it is really no need for validation (new
///   currency mapping)
/// - normal path will pay price (validate each time), in instead when fail pays only (like
///   trying to transfer non existing asset id)
/// - we cannot guarantee existence of asset as it may be removed during transaction (so we
///   should make removal exclusive case)
///
/// Given above we stick with possibly wrong asset id passed into API.
///
